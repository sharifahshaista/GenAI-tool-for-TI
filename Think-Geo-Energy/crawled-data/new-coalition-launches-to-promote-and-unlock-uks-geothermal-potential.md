[**Geothermal UK**](https://www.geothermaluk.org/) , a coalition bringing together all facets of the geothermal industry, has launched today to champion geothermal energy as a key part of the UK’s clean energy transition.
Founding members include [TownRock Energy](https://townrockenergy.com/), [Causeway Geothermal](https://causewaygt.com/), and [Eden Geothermal](https://www.edengeothermal.com/).
The coalition, which includes developers, the supply chain, academic experts and public bodies, aims to unify the sector’s voice and advocate for supportive policy frameworks and investment to unlock the enormous untapped potential of geothermal energy in the UK.
_“We’re launching Geothermal UK to raise awareness of all geothermal technologies delivering decarbonised heat, cooling and power, and to speed up the roll-out of this critical clean energy solution,”_ said **Anne Murrell** , founder of the coalition. _“Geothermal is local and ready to scale, and is indispensable for our net zero future. European countries such as France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands are already experiencing the benefit of their geothermal resources at scale; it’s time for the UK to catch up.”_
The coalition’s launch comes amid growing momentum for geothermal in the UK, with many regional initiatives underway and key supply chain trade bodies, such as **OEUK** , mobilising for geothermal delivery. Geothermal UK plans to serve as the central coordinating voice to support implementation, investment and industry growth.
_“Deep Geothermal remains to be[ a renewable opportunity that we are failing to realise to its full potential.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/uk-mp-publishes-report-on-uks-deep-geothermal-potential/) I would always encourage the industry, that understands this very well, to do whatever it can to work together to consistently explain to government what they can offer and the benefits for regional growth, transition jobs, the environment and decarbonisation. I welcome any initiative that helps them to do this.” _**Dr. Kieran Mullan** , MP for Bexhill and Battle and Chairman / Founder of the Deep Geothermal APPG.
_“Collaboration is essential if we are to realise the full potential of geothermal energy in the UK. By uniting industry, academia, policymakers, and other key stakeholders through this coalition, we can share expertise, de-risk projects, and build the momentum needed to make geothermal a key part of our energy mix. This is an exciting step towards delivering sustainable, indigenous energy that benefits everyone, ”_**Stuart Sinclair** , CEO, Consortium Drilling
_“Geothermal is key to ensuring[a just transition of energy jobs](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/nhs-townrock-energy-to-evaluate-geothermal-heating-potential-in-aberdeen-scotland/), driving local and national economic growth and providing the UK’s energy security. Working together in this coalition is key to achieving scale as quickly as possible,” _**David Townsend** , CEO, TownRock Energy.
_“The UK Geothermal industry can transform the efficiency of the UK energy system by reducing the need for electrification. We are standing on[a source of clean, cost-effective energy](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/beyond-the-biomes-eden-geothermal-empowers-agriculture-and-education-in-the-uk/) that can be accessed at scale by working in an aligned way; now is the time to go beyond individual projects and establish the systems that will build a new sustainable industry in the UK,__”_**Tom Grand** , CCO, Eden Geothermal.
