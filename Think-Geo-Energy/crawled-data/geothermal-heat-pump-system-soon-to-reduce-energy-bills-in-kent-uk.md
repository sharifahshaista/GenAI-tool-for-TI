A geothermal heating project using heat pump technology will soon deliver reduced energy bills to a number of households in the Ashford Borough in Kent in southeastern England. For this project, the [Ashford Borough Council](https://www.ashford.gov.uk/) is working with UK ground source heat pump (GSHP) specialist [Kensa](https://kensa.co.uk/).
As part of the initiative, multiple boreholes will be drilled to 100 meters depth and fitted with heat gathering systems. Energy harnessed from the boreholes will then be fed to heat pumps, which allows for the boosting of low-grade heat to higher temperatures, making the energy appropriate for low-cost space heating and hot water to residential units. The scheme will be implemented in 74 homes in the villages of Appledore and Charing, thus replacing a mix of oil-fired, electric, and gas heating systems.
The response from the community has been very positive. _“I think this is a great idea. Our electric storage heaters are expensive to run and I’m looking forward to saving the pennies and have a warmer, more comfortable home,”_ said Craig Godden, a resident of the Heathside area in Appledore.
_“Storage heaters are costing me a fortune so this is a very good idea. My daughter is jealous that I’m getting ground source heat pumps fitted.”_ said Peter Simpson, another resident.
_“We’re excited to collaborate with Ashford on this brilliant project, helping to decarbonise their properties while providing residents with a reliable, highly efficient low-carbon heating solution,”_ added Stuart Gadsden, Commercial Director at Kensa.
_“Our ground source heat pumps are among the most energy-efficient and sustainable heating options available and, depending on the system they replace, residents could benefit from significantly lower energy bills and a heavily reduced carbon footprint. We have a proven track record of installing our British-made heat pumps in thousands of social homes and are looking forward to extending these benefits to even more residents through this initiative with Ashford.”_

#### **Part of energy-saving measures**
The scheme is part of a bigger drive by the Ashford Borough Council to retrofit around 700 homes with energy-saving measures using Government funding of £5.1m. The money – from the Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund Wave 2 – is bolstered by a £6.2m contribution from the council.
Working with a delivery partner, improvements already delivered over the past 18 months includes cavity wall insulation, external wall insulation, new windows and doors, under floor insulation, air source heat pumps and solar panels.
Cllr Noel Ovenden, Council Leader and Portfolio Holder for Housing, said: _“These measures will cut carbon emissions, help reduce energy demand and give residents more money in their pockets from cheaper energy bills. We’re working closely with our tenants to ensure they understand how the GSHP systems work and to recognise the tremendous benefits they will enjoy because of these exciting improvements._
Kensa has published a short video overview of the project, which you can watch below:
