The[ Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States](https://oecs.int/en/) (OECS) Commission has launched **“**[**Power Below The Surface: Harnessing Geothermal Energy in the OECS**](https://bit.ly/powerbelowthesurfaceflipbook)“, a publication that details the current status of geothermal development in the Eastern Caribbean and provides an outlook for the future of this sector.
The booklet was launched in a special “OECS sustainable energy celebration” at the climax of the 3rd Nationally Determined Contributions Investment Forum and Marketplace, held at the Radisson Grenada Beach Resort from March 31 to April 2. It was formally presented to Hon. Konris Maynard of St Kitts and Nevis, the current chair of the OECS Council of Ministers: Energy by Dr. Ernie Stapleton, OECS GEOBUILD’s Project Manager.
This comprehensive, 48-page publication, developed under the OECS Geothermal Energy: Capacity Building for Utilisation, Investment and Local Development ([GEOBUILD](https://oecs.int/en/geobuild)) Programme, details the current status of geothermal projects across the region, from [Dominica’s advanced 10-MW power plant development](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/dominica-pm-provides-update-on-construction-of-laudat-geothermal-power-plant/) scheduled for completion in December 2025 to emerging projects in four other Member States: [Grenada](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/grenada-geothermal-project-receives-further-funding-support-from-cbd-and-uk-fcdo/), [Saint Kitts and Nevis](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/nevis-geothermal-project-going-into-bidding-process-for-drilling/), [Saint Lucia](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/world-bank-to-support-geothermal-exploration-at-saint-lucia-caribbean/), and [St Vincent and the Grenadines](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/st-vincents-grenadines-officials-reassure-support-of-geothermal-project/).
The booklet also addresses key aspects of geothermal development, including environmental benefits, economic advantages, and various technological approaches to geothermal power generation.
_“This publication marks a significant milestone in our region’s journey toward energy security and sustainability as we place on record the journey towards geothermal energy development from the Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) context,”_ said Judith Ephraim, Programme Director, Sustainable Energy, of the OECS Commission.
_“Whilst many islands have good potential for geothermal energy, the unique nature of geothermal and the circumstances of SIDS makes the development of geothermal though a worthwhile undertaking, one which needs strong commitment, strategy and partnerships. It is therefore important to understand the steps taken so far to build on the knowledge base for geothermal ? development on islands.”_
The publication of “**Power Below The Surface”** comes at a crucial moment as the OECS embarks on a Decade of Action for Sustainable Energy Development. This comprehensive synopsis underscores the exceptional promise of geothermal energy in the Eastern Caribbean, where volcanic geology creates ideal conditions for this renewable resource.
“**Power Below the Surface** ” is available in both print and digital formats, with the [ _electronic version_](http://bit.ly/powerbelowthesurfaceflipbook) accessible at [ _www.oecs.int/geobuild_](http://www.oecs.int/geobuild).
