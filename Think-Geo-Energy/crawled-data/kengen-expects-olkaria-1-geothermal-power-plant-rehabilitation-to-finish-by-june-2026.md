Rehabilitation work on the Olkaria I geothermal power plant in Kenya is now at 70% completion, and commissioning of the first turbine is expected by June 2026. This update was provided by [KenGen](https://kengen.co.ke/index.php?view=article&id=1) Managing Director and CEO, Eng. Peter Njenga at the sidelines of the Africa Energy Forum, held in Cape Town, South Africa.
The Olkaria I geothermal power station, the oldest in Kenya, [was shut down in 2023](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/works-starts-on-olkaria-i-geothermal-power-station-rehabilitation-kenya/) to give way to rehabilitation work. In 2024,[ Toshiba ESS was awarded the contract to supply steam turbines and generators](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/kengen-taps-toshiba-for-olkaria-geothermal-power-plant-uprating/) to Units 1 to 3, increasing the old capacity of 45 MW to 63 MW after rehabilitation.
According to the latest update by Njenga, the two steam turbines and generators for Units 2 and 3 have now been delivered to the projec site. The final set, destined for Unit 1, has been dispatched and is currently in transit. KenGen expects all the critical equipment to arrive by the end of this month. Other major power plant components have already arrived and several have been installed.
_“We have a large team of 928 people including elite project engineers, technicians, foremen, artisans, and general workers, led by the General Manager, Business Development & Strategy, Elizabeth Njenga and the Design and Construction Manager, Eng. Isaack Maina working day and night to deliver the project ahead of time and on budget,”_ added Njenga.
The rehabilitation of Olkaria I will bring Kenya closer to its goal of being powered by 100% clean energy by 2030, as well as joining [the 1-GW club of countries](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/thinkgeoenergys-top-10-geothermal-countries-2024-power/) in terms of installed geothermal power capacity.
