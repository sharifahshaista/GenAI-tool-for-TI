The Senate Department for Mobility, Transport, Climate Protection and the Environment (SenMVKU) of the State of Berlin in Germany has received approval for the for the large-scale mining permit area “Erdwärme Berlin” for the exploration of deep geothermal energy. The permit was issued by the[ State Office for Mining, Geology and Natural Resources](https://lbgr.brandenburg.de/) (LBGR).
The approval comes from a permit application by the State of Berlin for a deep geothermal exploration program covering a contiguous permit area covering the entire city. Thie proposed activities will include extensive drilling and 3D seismic surveys, as outlined in the [“Roadmap for Deep Geothermal Energy in Berlin”](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/berlin-germany-to-expand-geothermal-drilling-program/) adopted by the Senate in 2023.
The approved field covers an area of 550 km², and the mining permit is valid for five years. With the permit now granted, extensive geological exploration can proceed throughout the city to identify and characterize potential geothermal resources for the long-term supply of Berlin. Exploration activities will be carried out by the State of Berlin in cooperation with municipal and private heat network operators.
The permit also authorizes the State of Berlin to initiate the succeeding steps in the expansion of deep geothermal energy utilization, including pilot drilling and statewide reservoir management. The ultimate goal is coordinated and nationwide management of geothermal projects to decarbonize district and local heating supplies by 2045.
_“With today’s decision, we have the green light for our ambitious project – deep geothermal heat from the underground for Berlin! It is a crucial milestone on the path to climate-neutral heat supply for the capital by 2045. We are now creating the conditions to supply clean and price-stable energy in the coming years,”_ commented Ute Bonde, Senator for Mobility, Transport, Climate Protection and the Environment.
