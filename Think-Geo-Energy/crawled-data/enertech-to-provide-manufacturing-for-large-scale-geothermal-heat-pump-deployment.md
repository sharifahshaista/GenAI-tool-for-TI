Geothermal heat pump manufacturer [Enertech Global](https://enertechusa.com/) (Enertech) has been selected as the manufacturing partner by [Dandelion Energy](https://dandelionenergy.com/) for the deployment of geothermal HVAC systems for over 15000 homes in Colorado.
[Announced a few weeks ago](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/dandelion-energy-and-lennar-to-deploy-geothermal-heat-pumps-to-1500-homes/), the project envisions the integration of geothermal systems in 1500 new homes being built by [Lennar Corporation](https://www.lennar.com/) across 14 communities in Colorado, making it one of the largest deployments of geothermal heat pumps in US history. Over the next two years, Dandelion Energy will facilitate the drilling of individual ground loops and installation of Enertech heat pumps in these homes.
With the shift to [geothermal heat pumps](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/us-doe-study-shows-decarbonization-potential-of-geothermal-heat-pumps/), homeowners are expected to save approximately $30 million over 20 years compared to using air-source heat pumps. Homebuyers will also be eligible for the Section 25D clean energy credit, which provides a 30% federal tax credit for residential geothermal HVAC installations.
_“We are honored that the Dandelion team chose Enertech as a partner for this noteworthy project. It embodies our mission of revolutionizing the way homes and communities are heated and cooled,”_ said Enertech CEO Derek Dwyer._“Our team in Mitchell, SD is excited about what this will mean for the continued investment in their factory and job growth in their community.”_
_“Dandelion is proud to partner with Enertech to bring Lennar and their homebuyers a U.S. manufactured technology that harnesses the energy under their homes to deliver the most efficient heating and cooling solution available,”_ added Dandelion Energy CEO Dan Yates. _“This project delivers on our promise to make geothermal energy accessible and affordable.”_
