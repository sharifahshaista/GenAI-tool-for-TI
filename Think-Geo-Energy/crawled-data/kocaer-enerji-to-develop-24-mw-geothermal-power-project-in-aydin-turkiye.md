[Kocaer Enerji A.S](https://www.kocaersteel.com/tr/). has initiated the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process for the “Kocaer 1 Geothermal Power Plant and Resource Exploration Project,” which will have an installed capacity of 24 MWm/24 MWe. The project is located within the borders of Buharkent and Kuyucak districts in Aydin province, Türkiye, under the license area numbered IR J-443 (ER: 3315389).
This follows up on a feasibility study done by the company at the site, [as announced in 2023.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/kocaer-celik-to-conduct-feasibility-study-for-24-mw-geothermal-project-in-aydin-turkiye/)
The EIA Application File has been deemed appropriate by the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change and has been uploaded to the e-EIA system.
The project is expected to generate 192 GWh of electricity annually, which could meet the yearly energy demand of approximately 57,000 people. A total of 32 wells will be drilled within the license area, including 9 production wells, 6 reinjection wells, 1 alternative production well, and 16 exploration wells. Additionally, 2 temporary test pools will be constructed. The plant will utilize binary cycle technology and will consume a maximum of 2,300 tons of geothermal fluid per hour.
**Investment exceeds 3.1 billion TL (approximately 83.8 million USD)**
The total investment cost of the project is estimated at 3,182,624,000 TL. The financing will be provided through 80% loan and 20% equity. The construction and drilling phases are expected to be completed within approximately two years, and the plant is planned to operate for 49 years. During the construction and drilling phases, the project will create around 90 jobs, with priority given to local employment.
The plant site is located near the neighborhoods of Kurtulu?, Horsunlu, Gencelli, and Ortakç?. Since the license area overlaps with agricultural lands, forested areas, and certain tourism zones, the necessary permits will be obtained in accordance with the Olive Cultivation, Soil Conservation, and Pasture Laws. The EIA report is expected to be shared with the public, including details on environmental impacts, site selection, and mitigation measures.
Kocaer Celik is a company operating in the steel section segment of the iron and steel industry. Exporting to 140 countries on 6 continents, Kocaer Celik exports 84% of its production. Kocaer Steel’s subsidiary, Kocaer Steel UK, is a company established in the UK and has been carrying out sales, marketing, and distribution activities since 2015.
