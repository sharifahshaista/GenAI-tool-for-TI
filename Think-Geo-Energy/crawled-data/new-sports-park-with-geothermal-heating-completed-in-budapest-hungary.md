The use of geothermal for heating and hot water supply has become a highlight of the newly built MTK Budapest Sports Park in the middle of the former industrial area on Kerepesi Street in Budapest. The geothermal heating system complements the nearly 1000 solar panels that provide 500 kW of electricity to the facility, combining for a pioneering energy system focused on sustainability and reliability.
Work on the MTK Sports Park started in 2023 and has been headed by [Bayer Construct Zrt](https://bayerconstruct.hu/en/). The complex was built on almost 100,000 square meters of land and includes a multifunctional hall, indoor garage, and outdoor courts.
Geothermal heat is supplied by a deviated production well drilled to 1300 meters depth. Heat from the water is recovered, then the water goes back to the subsurface via a reinjection well. On the surface, both wells are located right next to each other. By using directional drilling, the wells are spaced at a distance of almost 1000 meters in the subsurface.
The geothermal heating scheme of the MTK Sports Park represents the first geothermal supply agreement signed by the [ Regulated Activities Supervisory Authority](https://sztfh.hu/) (SZTFH), under the new legislation that stipulates that thermal water extracted for geothermal utilization must be injected back into the geological medium. This legislation [came into force in March 2023.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/hungary-amends-laws-to-create-geothermal-framework/)
The project was also an important milestone for the construction company Bayer Construct, as it is their first project to use a geothermal-based heating system. Thus, it serves as their introduction of a new geothermal business.
The geothermal heat and hot water supply at MTK Sports Park was officially commissioned on 1 March 2205, in the presence of Energy Minister Csaba Lantos. At the ceremony, the Minister emphasized that Hungary is particularly blessed with abundant geothermal resources thanks to the excellent conditions in the Carpathian Basin.
