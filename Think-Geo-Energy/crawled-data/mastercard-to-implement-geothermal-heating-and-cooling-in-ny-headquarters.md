Multinational payment card service company [Mastercard](https://www.mastercard.com/) has announced the shift to geothermal energy for heating and cooling for their headquarters in Purchase, New York. This will be part of a wider company initiative to promote environmental sustainability by deploying renewable energy technology including geothermal and solar.
The geothermal project in Purchase seeks to replace the existing natural gas heating and cooling system. Natural gas use is responsible for more than half of the direct combustion of fossil fuels at the site, so it was an opportunity for the company to reduce their emissions.
Drilling of 160 boreholes each to 600 feet (182 meters) depth will be done that the lawn in front of the headquarters. Energy from the boreholes will be fed to a closed-loop [ground source heat pump](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/us-doe-publishes-series-of-geothermal-heat-pump-case-studies/). This system will siphon heat from the building, store it in the ground, and pump it back to the building during winter.
The company is also installing solar panel arrays on their Tech Hub in O’Fallon, Missouri, and on their headquarters in Dubai and the UK.
Mastercard states that the investments made in geothermal and solar technology is just the first phase of a broader commitment to build truly resilient energy systems, demonstrating that profitable businesses can also be good neighbors for the the local and wider global communities.
