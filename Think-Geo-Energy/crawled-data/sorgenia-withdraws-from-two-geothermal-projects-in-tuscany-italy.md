Energy company [Sorgenia](https://www.sorgenia.it/) has announced that it will no longer continue with plans to develop two geothermal power projects in the Tuscany region of Italy. The company cited economic reasons for withdrawing from the projects, exacerbated by a long authorization process and the company’s own imminent shareholder reorganization.
In 2022, the Italian government gave the green light to Sorgenia to proceed with two proposed geothermal projects – a [10-MW binary geothermal power plant in Val di Paglia](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/italy-pm-gives-go-ahead-for-10-mw-binary-geothermal-power-plant-in-tuscany/), and a [5-MW binary geothermal power plant in Poggio Montone](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/green-light-given-to-poggio-montone-geothermal-project-italy/).
The proposed projects of Sorgenia were important for two reasons – these would have been the first geothermal power plants in Italy not operated by Enel Green Power, and would have been the first deployment of commercial-scale binary power plant technology in Italy.
Sorgenia further stated that _“the evolution of the reference framework has made the implementation of the projects increasingly less sustainable from an economic point of view.”_ The company statement also alludes to efforts to involve other operators to finance the construction of the power plants. The ownership of Sorgenia is expected to change soon, with the American fund Sixth Street eyeing a 40% stake from the company, which is currently controlled by the F2i group.
The company says that it maintains that geothermal has a positive value in terms of its energy, environmental, and socio-economic benefits. However, Sorgenia will now refocus is efforts on the development of other renewable energy facilities.
