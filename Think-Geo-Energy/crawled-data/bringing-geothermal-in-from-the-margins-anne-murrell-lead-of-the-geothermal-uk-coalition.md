As the geothermal sector gains momentum in the UK, it has also started expanding into different technologies and markets. From its rich history of shallow geothermal heating, the UK has now had success in developing mine water heating schemes and emerging projects are looking into geothermal power generation and lithium extraction. With now a more diversified and rapidly growing sector, the **[Geothermal UK](https://www.geothermaluk.org/)** coalition was launched [to give the industry a unified voice](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-coalition-launches-to-promote-and-unlock-uks-geothermal-potential/).
Over the next few weeks, we will hear from some key UK industry players in the interview series:**‘Voices of Geothermal UK’.** UK developers, delivery experts and advisors will explain the opportunities they see for geothermal expansion in the UK, the challenges they are facing and the importance of collaboration to enable growth.
We start off this series with **Anne Murrell** , Lead of the UK Geothermal Coalition, as she discusses the objectives of the coalition, its current standing, the its next steps in advocating for geothermal in the UK.
Over the coming weeks, we will be publishing more interviews giving insights on the future of geothermal in the UK. Watch out for features on the following personalities:
  * Jordan Weddepohl, Arup
  * Tamsin Lishman, Kensa
  * Karen Spenley, Celsius Energy
  * David Townsend, TownRock Energy
  * Stuart Sinclair, Consortium Drilling
  * Gus Grand, Eden Geothermal


#### **What prompted the launch of Geothermal UK at this particular moment?**
Key industry stakeholders launched Geothermal UK earlier this year to address both the energy challenges and geothermal sector challenges in the UK.
Firstly, the UK is facing**energy challenges** which geothermal can help to solve. These include the climate crisis and resulting need for decarbonisation, rising energy costs and widespread fuel poverty, the need for energy security, and grid capacity issues as we shift to renewables. The government’s target for the UK to become a ‘Clean Energy Superpower’ aims to tackle these challenges, and geothermal has a key role to play in this.
Secondly, we are experiencing **geothermal industry challenges** as the sector beings to expand. We see growing momentum in specific areas and technologies, such as the deep geothermal projects in Cornwall, mine water projects in the North East, and city heat networks across the country. We need to optimise all this great work through national coordination, enabling strategic follow-through and the sharing of knowledge and experience. 
In summary, we need a unified voice to bring the industry together and engage policy: this is Geothermal UK.
#### **What is the vision or long-term ambition for the coalition?**
We want to establish geothermal as a mainstream part of the UK energy system, especially for clean heat. Geothermal UK will help to scale the sector responsibly and collaboratively. 
In practical terms we will support real project delivery, and we aim to become a trusted hub for all, including government, industry, local authorities and funders.

#### **How is Geothermal UK different from other organisations in this space?**
We are an industry-led, UK-focused coalition, grounded in implementation. Our governance model, underpinned by a Charter, enables the credible, inclusive coordination of – and collaboration with – all stakeholders, whilst championing the unique UK geothermal brand. 
Other organisations have powerful lobbying roles to play, or they represent key stakeholder groups and companies, or have a specific technical focus. And there are international groups, enabling the sharing of learnings across borders, and also organisations representing renewables as a whole, within which geothermal needs to have a seat at the table. 
Geothermal UK wants to collaborate with these organisations, bringing together all the facets required to support the growth of our UK geothermal industry.
#### **Who is involved so far, and how can others join?**
Geothermal UK is a coalition of geothermal stakeholders and supporters with developers at its heart. Founding members include representatives of all geothermal technologies, our supply chain and other experts. We are currently volunteer-led, and formalisation of our structure is on the horizon.
We welcome all who are aligned to our core principles to join the coalition, including industry, academics, customers, NGOs, funders and others. 
The first step is to sign the Charter (found on [www.geothermaluk.org](http://www.geothermaluk.org)), then participate in working groups as suits your interest, skill-set and time availability.
#### **What do you see as the biggest barriers to geothermal right now in the UK?**
The primary issue is lack of awareness of geothermal energy and its potential – within government, investors and the public. 
There is a lack of policy visibility and there are no dedicated support frameworks (permitting, regulation etc.). We need a national roadmap, integrating geothermal into our energy system.
#### **What are the next steps for Geothermal UK?**
Our event calendar is pretty full over the next couple of months, including the next in our series of MP breakfasts in Parliament, industry/ government roundtables and investor events. We are also continuing our webinar series to inform and engage with our community.
We are strengthening our working groups – policy, comms and funding – and making sure that geothermal energy in the UK is positioned prominently within broader discussions, at the same time as enhancing our strong, unique geothermal identity.
Regarding the organisation itself, we are exploring fiscal hosting options and developing funding avenues to move from a volunteer-based structure to sustainable operations.

#### **What message would you share with government or energy sector decision-makers?**
Geothermal energy provides a proven, place-based and sustainable solution. It provides clean heat at scale, and can play a key role in Britain’s ambition to become a Clean Energy Superpower. Geothermal energy is underutilised in the UK and should have strategic focus within the UK energy system.
Geothermal UK is a credible industry voice to inform and co-create impactful policy, and a powerful coalition to enable the delivery of geothermal solutions across the UK.
Our earth has huge potential to fulfil our energy needs – let’s use it!
#### **Finally – what’s your call to action for those reading this?**
If you believe that geothermal will play a vital role in the UK’s energy future, join us! Whether you’re a developer, policymaker, community leader, funder or engineer, Geothermal UK needs your input. Help us build the future of UK geothermal together.
