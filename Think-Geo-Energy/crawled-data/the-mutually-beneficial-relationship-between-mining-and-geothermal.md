Mining and geothermal energy share a mutually beneficial and historical relationship, and capitalizing on this convergence can help boost both industries.

A recently published article written by Marit Brommer and Helen Robinson of the [International Geothermal Association](https://worldgeothermal.org/) (IGA) highlights the huge opportunity of the mining and geothermal energy industries to empower each other, both in terms of exploiting economic opportunities and developing complementary skills.
**Click here to read the full article,[“Striking heat and metal: why mining and geothermal should forge a new alliance.”](https://www.seequent.com/striking-heat-and-metal-why-mining-and-geothermal-should-forge-a-new-alliance/)**
The mining and geothermal energy industries have already had history of working together. The first geothermal power plant in Africa was built in the Katanga Province of the Democratic Republic Congo. Although modest in size at only 250 kW capacity, the binary plant provided power to the local tin mining operations using water from a nearby 91 °C hot spring.
A more recent example is [the Lihir geothermal power plant in Papua New Guinea](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/gold-mining-in-png-when-geothermal-heat-is-a-challenge/), which has been supplying power to gold mining operations since 2003. Today, this project is considered a model in the use of geothermal energy for more sustainable mining activities.
Another form of synergy between mining and geothermal can be found in the UK and the Netherlands, where water from flooded mine galleries are used to provide low-carbon heating to houses, schools, and businesses. A mine water heating scheme [has been operational in Gateshead since 2023](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/gateshead-uk-mine-water-geothermal-heating-scheme-hailed-a-success/), and [another in Wales](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/mine-water-heat-scheme-in-wales-uk-starts-operations/) just started operating a few months ago.
Mining and geothermal share many core exploration methods such as geophysical data acquisition, surface mapping, geochemical sampling and 3D modeling. One such example is the geological modeling software developed by [Seequent](https://www.seequent.com/), which was initially created for mining. However, the subsurface modeling portfolio of Seequent has [played a critical role in shaping the geothermal industry globally](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/interview-how-seequent-remains-relevant-amidst-an-evolving-geothermal-industry/) for more than a decade now.
The circularity of this relationship is immediately apparent in the high demand of the geothermal industry for specialty metals, whether in drilling, well construction, or surface infrastructure. Thus, there are several avenues in which the convergence of these two industries can be capitalized on. The article calls for the following concrete measures:
  * Integrated licensing for overlapping geothermal and mining tenures
  * Open data platforms for subsurface exploration and resource characterization
  * Co-investment strategies for joint geothermal-mining projects
  * Incentives for mine water geothermal planning in closure and reclamation stages
