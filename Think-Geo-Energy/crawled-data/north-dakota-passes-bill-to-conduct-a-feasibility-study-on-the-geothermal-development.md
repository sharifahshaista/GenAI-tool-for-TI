With the approval of Governor Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota, [Senate Bill 2360](https://legiscan.com/ND/bill/SB2360/2025) has been passed, mandating the conduct of a feasibility study on developing geothermal energy in the state. Part of this study will be an evaluation on the use of nonproductive oil and gas wells to generate geothermal energy through the use of a complementary energy extraction method.
The bipartisan bill was sponsored by Senators Claire Cory (R-Grand Forks), Kathy Hogan (D-Fargo), and Dale Patten (R-Watford City). The bill states that the feasibility study shall include an evaluation of:
  * The state’s geology and the feasibility of resource exploration and production of geothermal energy in the state;
  * Support opportunities for startup geothermal companies, including fostering innovation and promoting economic growth within the state’s energy sector;
  * The application of geothermal energy to nonproductive oil and gas wells to extend the life of the well through the use of a complementary energy extraction method;
  * Other opportunities to advance geothermal energy opportunities in the state.


The findings and recommendations of the study, including any proposed legislation required to implement the recommendations, shall be presented at the 70th legislative assembly.
#### **Leveraging existing expertise and workforce**
Speaking at the North Dakota Senate Energy and Natural Resource Committee Hearing for SB 2360 last February, Jessica Eagle-Bluestone of [Geothermal Rising](https://geothermal.org/) provided testimony on how North Dakota can benefit from geothermal energy development: _“North Dakota has long been an energy leader. This study presents an opportunity to evaluate how geothermal energy can strengthen energy security, create jobs, and drive economic growth while utilizing our state’s skilled workforce and expertise. “_
_“Adding geothermal to North Dakota’s energy mix strengthens energy security and ensures long-term reliability and resilience. By leveraging our existing subsurface expertise and skilled workforce, we can advance this proven energy source while maintaining North Dakota’s position as a leader in energy development._
_Geothermal energy creates high-paying jobs and provides a direct path for oil and gas workers to apply their expertise in a growing sector. By tapping into North Dakota’s skilled workforce, we can accelerate development and ensure local workers benefit from this expanding industry.”_
Incidentally, [Gradient Geothermal has already deployed their geothermal power generation and fluid cooling services](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/gradient-to-generate-geothermal-power-in-north-dakota-oil-and-gas-facility/) to the existing oil and gas production infrastructure of Chord Energy in North Dakota. The company specializes in [technology for generating geothermal power in oilfield assets](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/interview-how-gradient-geothermal-taps-into-the-geothermal-potential-of-oilfields/).
