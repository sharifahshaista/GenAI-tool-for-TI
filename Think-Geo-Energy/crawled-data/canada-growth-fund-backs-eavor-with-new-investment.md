Canada Growth Fund Inc. (CGF) has announced a financing commitment of up to approximately CAD 138 million (about USD 100 million) to support the development and commercial deployment of geothermal systems by Eavor Technologies Inc., a Calgary-based energy technology company.
Founded in 2017, Eavor is advancing a proprietary closed-loop geothermal solution known as the Eavor-Loop™. The company is currently constructing its first commercial-scale project in Geretsried, Germany.
Under the new agreement, CGF will invest approximately CAD 89 million (around USD 47 million) at financial close, with an additional CAD 48 million (approximately USD 35 million) contingent on meeting defined project milestones.
This follows CGF’s earlier investment of CAD 90 million (approx. USD 66 million) in October 2023, part of Eavor’s Series B equity raise. The new commitment will further strengthen Eavor’s ability to scale its technology internationally, while maintaining its operational base and employment footprint in Calgary, Alberta.
“We are grateful for CGF’s continued commitment to our Canadian company, which uses Albertan expertise to drive innovation in the development of new advanced geothermal technologies,” said John Redfern, Co-founder and CEO of Eavor.
“Our continued investment in Eavor, as the company completes the first commercial-scale application of its technology, is a prime example of CGF’s steadfast commitment to scaling up Canadian companies and investing at a critical stage of their development,” said Yannick Beaudoin, President and CEO of Canada Growth Fund Investment Management Inc.
Since its launch in June 2023, CGF has committed approximately CAD 2.7 billion (roughly USD 2 billion) across 13 investments in Canadian projects and companies focused on scaling clean technology solutions.
