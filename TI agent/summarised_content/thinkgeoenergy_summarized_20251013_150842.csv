A temperature of over 150°C is expected in the future geothermal reservoir at a depth of 4,500 to 5,000 meters. * The borehole casing was then perforated to a depth of 3,800 meters. * Eight seismometers were lowered to the bottom of the borehole. These were calibrated using a vibrating truck. * Water injection began on 8 July. This was done using pumps normally installed in the underground laboratory in Val Bedretto and loaned by ETH Zurich. Over several days, the flow rate and pressure were gradually increased, reaching a maximum of 80 l/min and 270 bar. * Water injection was stopped on July 14 due to the threshold magnitude being reached twice, in accordance with established guidelines. The well was opened to relieve pressure. The total injected volume was 430 cubic meters. The plan included an optional second stimulation cycle (500 cubic meters), but this was not necessary, as sufficient data was acquired. * Complementary hydraulic and geophysical measurements and monitoring and observation of seismicity, reflux, and all the monitored parameters were done unit the last day on 31 July. For background, the project parameters states that the injection will be temporarily suspended for analysis if the seismicity reaches a magnitude of 0.3. Moreover, the tests will be permanently stopped if magnitude 0.9 was reached. If the magnitude were to reach 1.5, the well pressure will be released. The data collected will make it possible to characterize the mechanical and hydraulic properties of the rock and thus define the operational parameters of the effective stimulation (pressures, flow rates, durations) and the optimal orientation of the future horizontal drilling. Stimulation of the geothermal reservoir is planned during the second phase. Several specialists were on hand 24/7 to ensure that operations were done safely and according to agreed upon threshold standards. Although the injection was carried out continuously, no noise pollution was created. Environmental monitoring, including the analysis of flowback water, was done by a qualified engineering firm. The well seismometers recorded a total of 3,387 seismic events as of 31 July, all of very low magnitude. Only four tremors could be detected during injections by the surface network and located by the Swiss Seismological Service (SED) at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), as part of its independent basic seismic monitoring. The strongest tremor detected on this network was at a 0.3 magnitude. As expected, seismic activity decreased sharply as soon as injections ended. It is now only 2 or 3 microseisms per day, compared to several hundred during the tests. Continuous monitoring of pressure and seismicity remains in place. Over the next few months, operational activities will be limited to maintenance work and any additional measurements.

Technically, this project demonstrates: * Low-temperature district heating (\~45 °C supply / \~30 °C return) for residential needs. * Decentralized or centralized heat pump strategies for flexibility. * A community ownership and governance model that simplifies financing and grid integration. This model showcases how geothermal heating can be embedded in urban planning, reducing emissions and creating energy resilience at a neighbourhood scale. However, the approach is limited in temperature delivery and primarily suited for low-density residential demand, reflecting a broader trend identified by EGEC. The [EGEC Geothermal Market Report 2024](https://www.egec.org/media-publications/egec-market-report-2024-key-findings/) paints a mixed picture for the European sector: * Pipeline growth is significant, with 500+ district heating and cooling (DHC) projects under development and a potential doubling of installed capacity by 2030. * Technical and regulatory hurdles — permitting delays, exploration complexity, and financing risk — are slowing down deployment timelines. * Innovation needs include: * Higher-temperature systems for industrial applications, * Integration of Thermal Energy Storage (TES), * More robust digital monitoring and control tools to de-risk investments. The report highlights geothermal’s role in relieving electrical grid stress, particularly during demand peaks, and anticipates support from the European Geothermal Action Plan to address structural barriers. The market’s message is clear: while grassroots initiatives like Hyllegaard demonstrate feasibility and social acceptance, the next leap requires technical innovation that pushes beyond residential heating and enables geothermal to serve industrial, high-density, and flexible energy systems. **GEOFLEXHEAT: closing the innovation gap** **Innovation** | **Contribution to sector needs** ---|--- Heat Pipe Heat Exchanger & Scaling Reactor | Extracts more energy per well and mitigates mineral scaling, reducing operation and maintenance costs and enabling mineral byproduct recovery. High-Temperature Heat Pump (HTHP) | Raises geothermal output to >110 °C, meeting industrial steam demand—expanding geothermal beyond residential DH. TES & Steam Accumulators | Provide dispatchable thermal energy, supporting grid balancing and industrial flexibility. Digital Twin and Control Strategy | Simulates and optimizes system performance in real time, reducing operational risk and accelerating permitting. Commercialisation Roadmap & Social Acceptance Guide | Builds on lessons from community-led projects like Hyllegaard, scaling them to pan-European industrial systems. By integrating these elements, GEOFLEXHEAT turns geothermal into a flexible, multi-use resource — a key lever for Europe’s decarbonization plans. The three sources form a continuum of innovation: 1. Hyllegaard Høje provides proof of concept for scalable, low-temperature, community-owned geothermal solutions. 2. EGEC’s market report highlights systemic challenges — from permitting to scalability — that limit replication and industrial deployment. 3. GEOFLEXHEAT delivers the technical answers, moving geothermal into higher-value markets through advanced heat exchange, heat pumps, TES, and digitalization. Together, these perspectives create a technology-to-market pipeline: pilot and community projects like Hyllegaard showcase feasibility and build social trust; market data and policy identify bottlenecks and future opportunities; and last but not least, R&I initiatives deliver transformative solutions to overcome those bottlenecks. This approach ensures geothermal energy progresses from niche residential heating to a central pillar of Europe’s renewable energy mix. By 2030, integrating modular thermonet deployment with high-temperature heat extraction and TES could enable: * Urban and industrial hubs to decarbonize heating at scale. * Communities to actively manage energy at neighbourhood level, as in Hyllegaard. * A mature geothermal sector supported by EU-wide innovation, investment, and permitting reform. In this ecosystem, GEOFLEXHEAT is the missing link: it connects grassroots innovation and market intelligence with high-impact technological advances, positioning Europe as a global leader in geothermal energy.

turkiye-explores-lithium-recovery-from-geothermal-wells.md,https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/turkiye-explores-lithium-recovery-from-geothermal-wells/,Türkiye explores lithium recovery from geothermal wells,Alexander Richter,4 Jun 2025,"Türkiye is exploring lithium and rare metal extraction from geothermal brine, aiming to boost its EV battery supply chain and geothermal sector development. Türkiye is stepping up efforts to extract lithium and other strategic minerals from its geothermal resources, signaling a new chapter in the country’s geothermal development. With only about 10% of its geothermal potential currently utilized, Türkiye is looking beyond power and heat production toward integrating mineral recovery from geothermal brine. According to Ufuk Sentürk, chairman of the Turkish Geothermal Power Plant Investors Association (JESDER), the country operates over 1,000 geothermal wells capable of producing 100,000 tons of hot water per hour. This geothermal brine contains valuable metals such as lithium, germanium, selenium, and others, offering an opportunity to bolster Turkey’s energy transition and local industrial supply chains. Research efforts involving the German Energy Agency and local universities show promising early results for lithium recovery. While the average lithium concentration in Turkish geothermal waters is about 20 ppm – lower than the 100 ppm seen in parts of Germany—the scale of geothermal operations could yield up to 35,000 tons of lithium annually. This would represent close to 10% of global production in 2024. Such output could strategically position Türkiye within the electric vehicle (EV) battery supply chain. The country already hosts automotive plants by manufacturers such as Toyota, Renault, and Ford, and is promoting domestic EV production and energy storage systems. Utilizing geothermal lithium could strengthen domestic supply security and cost competitiveness. Beyond lithium, geothermal fluids may also offer economically viable extraction of metals like zinc and manganese, important for batteries and electronics. Systematic sampling and geological mapping are underway to assess broader mineral extraction potential. Türkiye’s state-owned mining company Eti Maden is also moving forward with a pilot lithium carbonate production plant using boron ore wastewaters, targeting 10 tons of output annually. This facility, set to launch before the end of the year, will help validate new technologies for lithium extraction and pave the way for geothermal integration. The government continues to support geothermal applications beyond power, with geothermal heat now used for 160,000 households and 7,000 hectares of greenhouses. Combining thermal energy use with mineral recovery could significantly enhance the sector’s overall economic value. Environmental concerns are also a key driver. Compared to conventional mining or salt lake evaporation, geothermal lithium extraction has a smaller environmental footprint. Its closed-loop water circulation helps avoid land degradation and aligns better with ESG and sustainability goals. If Türkiye can successfully scale geothermal mineral extraction, it could join other global frontrunners such as California (USA), Cornwall (UK), and the Rhine Valley (Germany). With a current installed geothermal capacity of 1.74 GW—ranking fourth globally—and a remaining potential of up to 5 GW, Turkey has both the resource base and industrial motivation to become a key player in the emerging geothermal lithium sector.","energy transition, EV battery supply chain, Geothermal, geothermal brine, Lithium extraction, Türkiye","Turkey is advancing the extraction of lithium and other strategic minerals from geothermal brine to strengthen its EV battery supply chain and diversify geothermal sector outputs.

The [Geological, Mining, and Metallurgical Institute](https://www.gob.pe/ingemmet) (Instituto Geológico, Minero y Metalúrgico / INGEMMET) of Peru has published the results of detailed studies done to evaluate the potential of the Tutupaca geothermal site, located in the Candarave district the Tacna region. The full paper, **“Caracterización y evaluación del potencial geotérmico de la zona geotermal de Tutupaca, Candarave, región Tacna”** by Cruz et al, can be accessed via this link: **<https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12544/5122>** A geothermal system of volcanic origin has been identified in the Tutupaca area. The heat comes from a magma chamber that is part of the Tutupaca Volcanic Complex, a structure formed by three superimposed volcanic edifices: Tutupaca Basal, Tutupaca West, and Tutupaca Recent. The existence of this heat source is manifested on the surface through various geological elements. The field is characterized by a series of visible manifestations that indicate heat stored beneath the volcano: hot springs, fumaroles (gas emissions), acidic mud pools, and sulfur deposits. From a geological perspective, Ingemmet scientists have identified rocks dating from the Cretaceous (more than 100 million years ago) to the Quaternary, with the presence of tuffs, ignimbrites, and volcano-sedimentary sequences. These rocks and geological structures, such as faults oriented mainly in a northwest-southeast (NW-SE) direction, facilitate the rise of heat and the circulation of fluids at deep levels. More than 120 water samples for chemical analysis were collected between 2022 and 2023. Based on chemical geothermometry, reservoir temperatures in Tutupaca could be as high as 200 °C. This makes the potential resource ideal for power generation. To complement the study, geophysical techniques such as magnetotellurics, gravimetry, and aeromagnetics were applied. Based on a Monte Carlo simulation, the potential size of the geothermal resource in Tutupaca was estimated to be between 59 to 181 MWe. Stored heat calculations yielded similar values. With these figures, the most conservative scenario would provide electricity to approximately 287,000 homes, while the medium scenario would reach more than 530,000, and the most optimistic could supply approximately 884,000 homes. This is equivalent to covering the electricity demand of the entire Tacna region several times over. Geothermal heating can also be explored, particular in the high Andean provinces like Candarave, where winter temperatures can drop to -10°C. Community heating, greenhouses, and thermal baths are just some of the possibilities. Tutupaca has [long been a site of geothermal development interest in Peru](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/history-of-geothermal-energy-research-in-peru-and-implications-for-the-future/), with early surveys dating back to the 1980’s.

The Geothermal Exponential Opportunities Fund (GeoFund) is a program by Project InnerSpace that seeks to enable first-of-a-kind geothermal pilot projects that, if successful could be replicated on a global scale. It utilizes philanthropy to derisk geothermal pilots with potentially huge benefits to community and the economy, but cannot secure traditional forms of project financing. The village of Tapri in Himachal Pradesh is known for its apple orchards and horticultural produce. However, the lack of cold storage means that the harvest has to be sold quickly and often at low prices. The proposed cold storage facility will provide 500 tons of storage and fruit dehydration capacity, reducing waste and allowing farmers to sell their produce at premium prices. It also grants more stability to the revenue streams of the farmers while creating more local jobs. The Icelandic company Geotropy had previously also completed [a geothermal-powered drying facility for fruits and nuts](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/himachal-pradesh-india-to-set-up-geothermal-controlled-atmosphere-storage/) in the Kinnaur district. _“A widely recognized barrier to the rapid expansion of geothermal energy is the lack of pilot projects to demonstrate impact across the various technologies, applications, geologies, and geographies globally where it could be most impactful in economic development, energy security, and prosperity,”_ said Jamie Beard, Executive Director of Project InnerSpace. _“The Tapri pilot will tackle one of India’s most urgent agricultural challenges, lifting incomes, and proving a model to scale globally. We look forward to supporting the Geotropy team in the development of this pivotal project.”_ Project InnerSpace that applications similar to the Tapri pilot may be scalable to millions of hectares of cropland globally.

Fortunately, the ash cloud drifted eastward over the Pacific Ocean with **no populated areas along its path** , according to Kamchatka’s emergency services ministry. An “orange” aviation alert was i[ssued to warn aircraft of potential ash in the atmosphere](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/russia-cancels-tsunami-warning-kamchatka-after-quake-dormant-volcano-erupts-2025-08-03/#:~:text=The%20eruption%20of%20the%20volcano,to%20aircraft%2C%20the%20ministry%20said). Apart from heightened vigilance, authorities reported no injuries or damage from the eruption in this remote volcanic area. **Geothermal plants far from impact zone** _The Mutnovskaya 1 geothermal power plant (50 MW) in Kamchatka’s southern region. Despite recent tectonic and volcanic activity in Kamchatka, the peninsula’s geothermal power facilities have not been affected._ Kamchatka is home to three geothermal power plants operated by RusHydro, and importantly, these facilities are **not in close proximity** to the recent earthquake epicenter or erupting volcano. The plants are located in the southern and southwestern part of the peninsula, dozens of kilometers from the areas of volcanic activity. They include the following installations, according to ThinkGeoEnergy’s own research: * **Mutnovskaya 1** – 50 MW capacity * **Verkhne-Mutnovskaya** – 12 MW capacity * **Pauzhetskaya** – 12 MW capacity All three geothermal power stations are clustered south of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, whereas the July 30 quake and subsequent eruptions occurred far to the north and east. For example, the Mutnovskaya geothermal field is located about **60 km south** of Kamchatka’s capital city [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutnovskaya_Power_Station#:~:text=Mutnovskaya%20power%20station%20is%20a,1), near the Mutnovsky volcano plateau. In contrast, the active Klyuchevskoy volcano (which erupted after the large quake) lies roughly **450 km north** of Petropavlovsk. This geographic separation means the geothermal facilities did not experience the intense shaking or ash fall from those events. Officials have not reported any disruptions to the geothermal plants’ operations, and no evacuation or special measures were needed at the sites. In the case of Krasheninnikov’s eruption, its ash plume remained over uninhabited terrain and posed no threat to infrastructure. **Figure:** Kamchatka Peninsula in the context of the geothermal plants in the Asia-Pacific setting & the volcanoes (source: [ThinkGeoEnergy geothermal plant map](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/map/)) These observations underscore that Kamchatka’s geothermal power operations remain secure and **unaffected** by the recent natural events. A map illustrating the locations of the volcanoes and earthquake epicenter in relation to the geothermal plants would help visualize their wide geographic separation on the peninsula. (The planned map could pinpoint Krasheninnikov Volcano in the Kronotsky Nature Reserve, the offshore quake epicenter, and the Mutnovskaya/Pauzhetskaya geothermal sites in the south.) **Geothermal Operations and Ongoing Expansion** Not only have current geothermal operations continued without interruption, but Kamchatka is also moving forward with plans to expand its geothermal capacity. In late July, _RusHydro –_ the utility that owns all three existing geothermal plants – announced a new development initiative to boost renewable energy in the region. According to a recent RusHydro update, the company (through its local subsidiary Kamchatskenergo) has [**acquired a 51% stake** in Geothermal Energy LLC](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/rushydro-acquires-controlling-stake-of-geothermal-developer-in-kamchatka-russia/), a developer previously under Russian oil firm Zarubezhneft, as part of a partnership to build a second geothermal power station at Mutnovsky. The proposed **Mutnovskaya 2** plant will add **66.5 MW** of capacity in Kamchatka’s Mutnovsky geothermal area. This project also involves installing a new **16.5 MW binary unit** at the existing Mutnovskaya 1 power station to utilize additional heat from the field. Design and exploration work for Mutnovskaya 2 are expected to be completed by the end of 2027. Once operational, the expanded facilities will help meet growing electricity demand – a regional deficit of about 26–31 MW is projected by 2030 – and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. Crucially, the recent earthquake and volcanic eruption have not derailed these geothermal development plans. RusHydro has indicated that all geothermal plants continue to operate normally, and no adverse impacts have been observed at the project sites. The resilience of Kamchatka’s geothermal infrastructure amid seismic events highlights a key advantage of geothermal energy in this volcanically active region. Local authorities and plant operators will, of course, continue to monitor geologic activity, but as of now **geothermal power generation remains steady and secure**. **References:** * Reuters – _“Russia cancels tsunami warning for Kamchatka after quake, dormant volcano erupts”_ , Aug. 3, 2025 [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/russia-cancels-tsunami-warning-kamchatka-after-quake-dormant-volcano-erupts-2025-08-03/#:~:text=The%20Kamchatka%20branch%20of%20Russia%27s,itself%20stands%20at%201%2C856%20metres). * “Huge quake in Russia triggers tsunami warnings around Pacific”, July 31, 2025 [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/huge-quake-russia-triggers-tsunami-warnings-around-pacific-2025-07-30/#:~:text=July%2030%20%28Reuters%29%20,101%20on%20the%20peninsula),[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/huge-quake-russia-triggers-tsunami-warnings-around-pacific-2025-07-30/#:~:text=The%20Klyuchevskoy%20volcano%20on%20Russia%27s,highest%20volcanoes%20in%20the%20world). * ThinkGeoEnergy – _“RusHydro acquires controlling stake of geothermal developer in Kamchatka, Russia”_ , July 24, 2025 [thinkgeoenergy.com](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/rushydro-acquires-controlling-stake-of-geothermal-developer-in-kamchatka-russia/#:~:text=There%20are%20currently%20three%20geothermal,in%20Kamchatska%2C%20all%20under%20RusHydro), [thinkgeoenergy.com](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/rushydro-acquires-controlling-stake-of-geothermal-developer-in-kamchatka-russia/#:~:text=RusHydro%20has%20acquired%20majority%20stake,power%20plant%20in%20Kamchatka%2C%20Russia). * Wikipedia – _Mutnovskaya Power Station_ (accessed Aug. 2025) [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutnovskaya_Power_Station#:~:text=Mutnovskaya%20power%20station%20is%20a,1).

The 8.8 magnitude earthquake prompted tsunami warnings across the Pacific, with waves up to 5 meters observed in the Kuril Islands, though infrastructure largely remained unaffected due to robust warning systems. The seismic activity is linked to the region’s tectonic setting and likely triggered eruptions of the Klyuchevskoy and Krasheninnikov volcanoes, both notable for their activity and historical dormancy periods (~600 years). The ash plumes from Krasheninnikov, reaching approximately 6,000 meters into the atmosphere, drifted over the Pacific without threatening populated areas.

Therefore, wellbore physics may play a dominant, but highly undesirable, role in the system’s pressure response as recorded by the downhole pressure gauge. Significant portions of the Bourdet derivatives of geothermal well tests are expressions of these wellbore effects, rather than the reservoir’s pressure response. Due to their intensity and duration, they often (if not always…) overprint the true reservoir response, thereby making a reliable analysis of the reservoir characteristics impossible. In this webinar, numerical and analytical models show the consequences of not applying a downhole shutin while testing low-enthalpy geothermal wells. Although these simulations painfully expose the consequences and risks of wellbore physics, they cannot remove them. It is therefore strongly recommended to always execute a well test with a downhole shut-in, such that all wellbore effects are physically separated from the reservoir response. Only by doing so is the pressure recorded by the downhole gauge free of unwanted physical effects from the wellbore, allowing the reservoir parameters to be deduced with confidence. Pieter Bruijnen is a reservoir / production engineer at EBN in The Netherlands. At EBN he is involved in the development of the geothermal industry and in Underground Hydrogen Storage. Previously he worked as a petroleum engineer at TAQA Energy and as a reservoir engineer for SGS.

The presentation addresses the limitations of conventional surface shut-in techniques during geothermal well testing, which often conflate wellbore physics effects with true reservoir responses, complicating accurate reservoir characterization. Bruijnen will highlight that non-downhole shutin methods tend to obscure reservoir parameters, leading to unreliable data interpretations. Using numerical and analytical modeling, the webinar demonstrates that implementing downhole shut-ins effectively isolates reservoir responses from wellbore effects, enabling more precise reservoir parameter estimation. This approach is especially critical for low-enthalpy geothermal wells where wellbore effects are pronounced. The development underscores the importance of advanced testing protocols in geothermal exploration and reservoir management, aiming to improve the reliability of reservoir data and optimize resource extraction.

Although reservoir temperatures in Osijek are lower than in Velika Gorica, owing to geological characteristics and a shallower reservoir, the geothermal resources are still flexible enough to be adapted to local needs. In any case, successful results in both Osijek and Velika Gorica strengthen the proposition that Croatia host diverse and valuable geothermal resources. The AZU states that the plan is to start drilling additional wells at locations with confirmed geothermal potential once exploration in all four sites has been completed. The goal would then be to establish production and reinjection well pairs in the sites so that exploitation of the resources can begin.","AZU, Croatia, Croatian Hydrocarbon Agency, Crosco, Drilling, exploration, Geothermal, Osijek, well testing","In Osijek, Croatia, drilling testing of a newly drilled geothermal well has confirmed a reservoir temperature exceeding 100°C with an estimated thermal capacity of 5 MW, demonstrating significant geothermal potential. This development is part of the Croatian Hydrocarbon Agency's (AZU) broader exploration campaign, which includes sites at Velika Gorica, Vinkovci, and Zaprešic. The project, financed through Croatia’s EUR 8 million National Recovery and Resilience Plan, aims to utilize geothermal energy for district heating, agriculture, and economic growth. Crosco, a subsidiary of INA Group, provides drilling services, contributing to strategic efforts in decarbonization and energy security. Although Osijek's reservoir temperature is lower compared to Velika Gorica, its shallower geological profile offers adaptable applications. Successful exploration results across multiple sites underscore Croatia’s diverse geothermal resources in the Pannonian Basin, with plans for additional drilling to establish production and reinjection systems for resource exploitation.

Approval has been granted to start the stimulation tests for the much-anticipated geothermal project in Haute-Sorne in the canton of Jura in Switzerland. Stimulation testing is scheduled to begin by the 7th of July. Stimulation tests will happen over one to two weeks, while the entire process is expected to take about a month and a half. The operations will conclude with the installation of seismic sensors in the well for long-term monitoring. Being developed by [Geo-Energie Jura AG](https://www.geo-energie-jura.ch/), drilling of a geothermal well to 4000 meters depth[ was completed at the Haute-Sorne site in August 2024](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/drilling-completed-for-first-well-of-haute-sorne-geothermal-project-switzerland/). The project is a major milestone for geothermal in the region, as it is the first well drilled in the Jura Arc, between Geneva and Basel, that completely penetrates the sediments and reaches the crystalline basement. A series of geophysical measurements had been completed since then to better understand the Jura geology. A leak test of the borehole had also been completed as part of the preparation for hydraulic stimulation. The authorization is issued following verification by the cantonal authorities, with the support of their experts, of Geo-Energie Jura’s detailed work program. The stimulation tests will be carried out in the exploratory well, at a depth of approximately 3,800 meters. The tests involve injecting water from the municipal network, in stages and without the addition of chemicals, sand or solids, up to a maximum flow rate of 60 L/min. A sophisticated seismic monitoring system will enable precise monitoring of the microseismicity deliberately induced by these operations. The seismograms will be published and available in near real time. The data will be available [on the Swiss Seismological Service (SED) website](http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/fr/monitoring/special-networks/geothermal-energy-haute-sorne/project-description/) during the stimulation phase. The operator’s work program provides for the temporary interruption of injections for analysis if the local magnitude reaches 0.3. Moreover, stimulation tests will end if the magnitude reaches 1.5. The local magnitude values will be determined independently and bindingly by the SED under [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). The latter will also be responsible for defining within 48 hours whether the earthquakes are induced by tests or are natural. Analysis of the results of the stimulation tests will be crucial in determining the future of the project. After analysis, the operator will transmit the results of the exploratory phase to the Canton of Jura, including an update of the risk analysis and the geological model. This data, as well as its integration into the general plan for the next phase, will allow the competent services to assess the compliance of the second stage of the project. The Independent Expert Group (GEI), mandated to provide scientific monitoring related to the risk of induced seismicity, will support this analysis and then formulate recommendations to the Government. Based on the assessment by the cantonal services and the recommendations of the GEI, the Government may then validate or not the continuation of the project, specifying, where applicable, the authorization framework. As long as an authorization condition is not respected or if the risk level is not acceptable, the continuation of the project will not be authorized. **[RELATED: Positive conclusions on Haute-Sorne geothermal project reported by federal committee](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/positive-conclusions-on-haute-sorne-geothermal-project-reported-by-federal-committee/)**","ETH Zurich, Geo-Energie Jura, Geothermal, Geothermie, Haute-Sorne, hydraulic stimulation, Jura, seismic, seismic monitoring, stimulation, Switzerland","The Haute-Sorne geothermal project in Jura, Switzerland, developed by Geo-Energie Jura AG, has received approval to commence stimulation tests in July 2025, marking a significant advancement in regional geothermal exploration.

The proposal for a discovery insurance for geothermal projects in Germany is now back on the agenda of lawmakers, as discussed in a recent federal budget debate. A sum of EUR 50 million has been earmarked for this as commitment appropriations over the next four years. The proposal for a risk protection mechanism [was first announced as a joint loan programme](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/kfw-munich-re-introduce-risk-protection-mechanism-for-geothermal-in-germany/) of federal development bank [KfW](https://www.kfw.de/kfw.de-2.html) and insurance company [Munich Re](https://www.munichre.com/en.html) during last year’s Praxisforum Geothermie Bayern held in Pullach. Although the insurance had already been fully developed and coordinated for a launch in January 2025, it had to be suspended due to the early end of the legislative period of the previous coalition government. According to the [German Geothermal Association](https://www.geothermie.de/aktuelles/nachrichten) (BVG), the current draft budget for the insurance totals almost EUR 50 million. This is intended to cover a total of 65 projects over the next four years, with an investment volume of EUR 2 to 3 billion. Matthias Tönnis of Munich Re emphasizes the need for an insurance scheme to protect municipalities from the cost of failed geothermal drilling. _“By the time the first well is drilled, a municipality can incur upfront costs of 20 to 30 million euros,”_ explains Tönnis._“If the drilling doesn’t deliver what it expected, the money is gone.”_ The proposal of a geothermal discovery insurance fund addresses one of the major hurdles of geothermal development in Germany. This complements well with current efforts to expedite approvals and other bureaucratic processes, as proposed by The Geothermal Energy Acceleration Act (GeoBG). [A draft of this act has just been published](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/germany-publishes-new-draft-for-proposed-geothermal-energy-acceleration-act/) by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs.","Bundesverband Geothermie, BVG, Drilling, Finance, funding, Geothermal, Geothermie, Germany, Insurance, KfW, Legislation, Munich RE, risk mitigation","German lawmakers are revisiting plans to establish a EUR 50 million geothermal discovery insurance fund aimed at mitigating risks for geothermal projects. The initiative, initially proposed through a partnership between KfW, Germany’s federal development bank, and Munich Re, was set for launch in January 2025 but was delayed due to political changes and the end of the previous legislative period. The fund is designed to support approximately 65 projects over four years, with an estimated total investment of EUR 2-3 billion. The insurance aims to protect municipalities from the high costs associated with unsuccessful geothermal drilling, which can reach up to EUR 30 million per well, as highlighted by Munich Re’s Matthias Tönnis. This risk mitigation measure addresses a critical barrier in Germany’s geothermal development by reducing financial uncertainty, thereby encouraging municipal and private investment. The proposal aligns with broader regulatory efforts, such as the draft Geothermal Energy Acceleration Act (GeoBG), which seeks to streamline project approval processes.

A Geothermal-Based Net Zero Building has been inaugurated at the city of Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh, India. An array of ten boreholes, drilled to a depth of 120 meters each, provides space air conditioning to the building, thus far being able to maintain indoor temperatures of 22 °C while the outdoor temperature is at 43 °C. The building, designed and built for the Indian Army at CWE Jhansi, was built from the ground up to demonstrate the feasibility and benefit of net-zero technologies. The electricity supply of the building is primarily from photovoltaic panels, with a backup grid connection when solar power is not available. The ground source heat pump system is the only source of air conditioning. The project was commissioned by the Military Engineering Service of the Indian Army, seeking to build a facility with an Energy Performance Index (EPI) of less than 50. For location, buildings in the city of Jhansi have a standard recommended EPI of 144. The building was designed and delivered by [S.A.P.

Swedish company [Baseload Capital](https://www.baseloadcap.com/) has announced a strategic investment in Japanese geothermal energy developer [Furusato Netsuden](https://furusato-nd.co.jp/). The partnership aims to unlock Japan’s untapped geothermal potential and build a replicable model for sustainable energy development worldwide. Combining a global investment portfolio with a community-rooted business model, this strategic partnership aims to scale clean, renewable energy respectfully, revitalizing local economies while honoring cultural heritage. The investment is made through Baseload Furusato, a wholly owned subsidiary of Baseload Capital that is headquartered in Minato Ward, Tokyo. Furusato Netsuden brings deep local roots, trust, and operational expertise to the partnership, while Baseload Capital contributes international investment, global reach, and the power of committed owners such as Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures. Japan has the third largest geothermal potential globally, with an estimated 23 GW, yet its current installed capacity is only 576 MW. This represents a major untapped opportunity for a country whose Green Transformation (GX) Strategy aims for net-zero emissions by 2050. Geothermal energy is clean, always-on, and space-efficient. That makes it an ideal solution for a mountainous, densely populated nation with high reliance on energy imports and growing clean-energy demand from AI and data centers. Japan’s geothermal development has been slow, in part, because there’s no common business model that enables communities to share in the benefits. However, Furusato Netsuden and its local partners have developed a system to ensure communities benefit directly from geothermal energy. In 2011, residents of the Waita area in Oguni Town, Kumamoto Prefecture, formed the limited liability company Waita-kai, which is owned by the community. In partnership with Furusato Netsuden, they set out to develop geothermal power together [in a way that would revitalize the community](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/waita-japan-geothermal-development-in-harmony-with-onsen-operations/). The name Furusato Netsuden combines the words for “hometown”, “heat” and “electricity”. The [“Waita model”](https://furusato-nd.co.jp/about/waita-model/) is a model that positions geothermal energy as “local / regional heat,” rather than an “underground resource.” Thus, development is primarily led by the local communities rather than companies. Even in geothermal development areas in New Zealand, there have been cases where methods that benefit local vested interests, such as Maori trusts, have been adopted, ultimately accelerating geothermal power generation development in the short term. The same model is being applied for geothermal development ongoing in Oguni Town, Aso District, Kumamoto Prefecture, the Teshikaga area of Hokkaido, and other hot spring areas. This model protects local land rights, ensures development is carried out on a scale appropriate for the area, and guarantees some of the revenues are re-invested in the community. Furusato Netsuden and Waita-kai regularly hold meetings with residents to share updates on operations, development, and environmental monitoring. * In 2015, the 2 MW capacity Waita No. 1 geothermal power plant began commercial operation. * Waita No. 2, [currently under construction](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/construction-starts-on-waita-no-2-geothermal-power-plant-kumamoto-japan/), is expected to deliver 5 MW and go online in March 2026. * In addition to the 7 MW currently operating or under construction in Waita, the overall portfolio includes a tangible pipeline of projects across Japan that are expected to deliver an additional 30+ MW over the next five to ten years. _“Furusato Netsuden has successfully proven that community-based geothermal development works. Through this first investment, we’re proud and humbled to partner with them in scaling this approach, combining local engagement with sustainable energy development. Together, we aim to help Japan reach its 1.5 GW geothermal goal and strengthen national energy resilience,”_ said Alexander Helling, CEO of Baseload Capital. _“Since 2020, we’ve built a foundation of trust with Baseload Capital, and seen that they are a committed, long-term partner in Japan’s energy transition. Their role as a strategic investor provides financial stability for our current and future projects. They also bring valuable global resources, including technology, business insights and an international network of investors and energy partners,”_ added Kazuyuki Akaishi, Representative Director of Furusato Netsuden. The goal of this partnership is to support Japan’s 7th Strategic Energy Plan and GX (Green Transformation) while establishing a scalable, community-focused blueprint for clean energy development – creating global impact with local roots.","Baseload Capital, community engagement, Furusato Netsuden, Geothermal, investment, Japan, onsen, power plant, Waita No. 1, Waita No. 2","Baseload Capital has made a strategic investment in Japanese geothermal developer Furusato Netsuden, focused on expanding Japan’s geothermal capacity amid its 2050 net-zero emissions goal.

The first commercial mine water heat scheme in Wales in the UK has started operations, supplying clean and stable heat to an industrial facility near Ammanford. The project is part of the work commissioned by the Welsh government to map areas of Wales most suited for mine water heat schemes. The Mining Remediation Authority operates the Lindsay treatment scheme where an average of 25 liters of mine water per second is treated to remove about 28 kilograms of iron per day. This prevents the mine water from contaminating the local watercourses, including the Ffrwd Brook which flows into the River Loughor. This is important work in ensuring that aquatic ecosystems are maintained clean and healthy. The Lindsay operation has been ongoing since 2018. The mine water is naturally warm due to geothermal energy heating the water in former coal mines. Working in collaboration with local business Thermal Earth Ltd, the renewable heat project secured funding through Innovate UK’s New Innovators in Net Zero Industry, South West Wales initiative. The system works by using heat exchangers submerged in one of the settlement ponds at the Lindsay scheme to recover heat from mine water, which is then transferred to a nearby industrial unit to supply low-carbon heating and hot water, and is predicted to save 17.5 tonnes of CO2 per year. The new development in Wales follows the successful implementation of [a mine water heating scheme in Gateshead](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/gateshead-uk-mine-water-geothermal-heating-scheme-hailed-a-success/) which started operations back in 2023. _“It’s been incredibly rewarding to see this forward-thinking project, transforming part of our mining legacy into a source of clean, renewable heat,”_ said Andrew Simpson, head of Innovation, By-Products and Services at the Mining Remediation Authority. _“It’s a powerful example of how innovation, collaboration and technical expertise can work together to deliver real-world solutions to the climate challenge.”_ A short video on the Wales mine water heating and treatment scheme can be seen below: ??","Ammanford, Geothermal, heating, mine water, mine water heating, Mining Remediation Authority, UK, Wales","Wales has launched its first commercial mine water heating scheme, supplying low-carbon heat to an industrial facility near Ammanford, as part of the Welsh government's efforts to identify suitable sites for mine water geothermal projects.

With at least four geothermal projects in various stages of development, the village of Jinlun has emerged as one of the rising stars for Taiwan’s geothermal sector. However, local tribal communities have not fully embraced the onset of geothermal development in this area. Thus, efforts are underway for a more fair and inclusive energy transformation in Jinlun, which can have cascading effects for other geothermal projects in Taiwan. Located at the mouth of Jinlun River, the village of Jinlun has a well-established and thriving tourism industry. The Jinlun Wild Creek Hot Spring, located under the visually distinct Jinlun Rainbow Bridge, attracts tourists and outdoor enthusiasts all year long. It has also been a bathing place for the Paiwan people, a local tribe. Hot spring hotels are everywhere in Jinlun, and many of these are adorned with indigenous totems and decorations. When the Quanyang geothermal power project was first proposed, the Jinlun Village Chief Chen Zhiwei noted that the villagers already had a negative attitude towards it. In 2022, groundwater levels in Jinlun rapidly dropped by almost 10 meters. Local hot spring operators ascribed this to the drilling operations that were happening at the time, although it was proven that it was caused by a shallow earthquake. Although the dispute has ended, the negative attitude of the residents towards geothermal operators remains difficult to remedy. This is an issue that needs to be addressed, especially since the Quanyang geothermal power plant is working on a 500-kW expansion of its facilities. Upstream of the Jinlun River are also geothermal sites being developed including Huantai, Taiyi Honglun, and Jiuli. Earlier this year, members of the tribal groups took the initiative to establish a “Geothermal Communications Platform” so that their representatives can be represented in plans and negotiations for geothermal development. The aspiration is for the tribes to sit at the same table as the developers, the National Energy Agency, and the national and city government for a peaceful and continuous dialogue An event was held in January 2025 to provide an initial forum for this type of conversation. The “Taiwan Aboriginal Peoples and Geothermal Forum” was attended by members of the tribal groups and other stakeholders. Pastor Uduf Lebak of the Tayal National Council sang a prayer that signified that all hostility must be put aside so that all sides participate in a productive and peaceful discussion. _“Even though we are different ethnic groups, we will call each other the life community of the Jinlun River Basin,”_ added Chen Zhiwei, the convener of the Jinlun River Basin Alliance. Wang Shou-chen of the Taiwan Geothermal Association further gave recommendations on how members of the community can be empowered to be part of geothermal development. He proposed that developers train the local people to become citizen scientists and participate in environmental monitoring. Thus, they will be given active roles in managing the underground resource and maintaining the existing geothermal tourism sector. Taiwan has clearly built a healthy momentum in geothermal development, particularly with [the recent signing of a 10-MW geothermal PPA with Google](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/google-baseload-capital-ink-geothermal-ppa-in-taiwan/) for power supply to their data centers. It is prudent for the national geothermal sector to avoid and address pitfalls like lack of community acceptance for geothermal projects so that the momentum may continue, and such issues do not become magnified in future projects.","community acceptance, community engagement, Geothermal, Hot Spring, Jinlun, power plant, Quanyang, Taiwan, tourism, tribal land","Taiwan’s geothermal sector is experiencing significant growth, with at least four projects underway, including the Quanyang geothermal power plant, which is planning a 500-kW expansion. The Jinlun region has emerged as a key development site, but local tribal communities, notably the Paiwan, have expressed reservations, citing concerns over environmental impacts and community acceptability. In 2022, groundwater levels dropped nearly 10 meters following geothermal drilling, attributed to a shallow earthquake rather than project activities, yet local opposition persists. To address these issues, stakeholders established a “Geothermal Communications Platform” in early 2025, fostering dialogue among tribes, developers, and government agencies. The “Taiwan Aboriginal Peoples and Geothermal Forum” underscored efforts for inclusive participation and community empowerment, proposing training local residents as citizen scientists for environmental monitoring. Taiwan’s geothermal initiatives gained further momentum with a recent 10-MW Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Google, aiming to supply data centers and bolster renewable energy commitments. This strategic focus highlights the importance of community engagement for sustainable geothermal development, reducing resistance and ensuring the sector’s long-term growth.

The [Governing Council of the Canary Islands](https://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/principal/) has approved the start of geothermal resource exploration surveys on the island of Tenerife, particularly for a number of sites that were tendered back in 2021. The main goal for this project would be to assess geothermal potential for the sites, located in the southern part of Tenerife, through exploratory drilling, and thus assessing the feasibility of geothermal electricity generation. The “TF-Sur Soundings” project will involve four mining grids assigned in the tender. The Tahatan and Tikahit sites have been assigned to commercial entity Energia Geotermica de Canarias, while two sites in Barranco Hondo will be managed by the Technological Institute and Renewable Energies ([Instituto Tecnológico y Energías Renovables](https://www.iter.es/) / ITER). The licenses were awarded to these two companies [back in 2024](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-exploration-contracts-in-canary-islands-awarded-to-nine-entities/). Salient to the approval is the decision to exclude the “TF-Sur Soundings” project from the simplified environmental impact assessment procedure. This was done to comply with European regulations that establish a timeframe to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy in Europe. None of the surveys planned are located within natural areas belonging to the Canary Islands Network of Protected Natural Areas or the Natura 2000 Network, which justifies the decision. The council decided that initiating such a process could cause a delay that would be more environmentally damaging than the planned research activity itself. Furthermore, the project has been evaluated and validated by specialized technical personnel from the Canary Islands Government and the Tenerife Island Council. The government will implement all environmental monitoring protocols throughout its execution to ensure compatibility with the environment, as this project represents a real opportunity to move toward a cleaner, more renewable, and more indigenous energy model. Once the operation is complete and the drilling equipment is dismantled, the ground will be restored to its original state, ensuring no permanent environmental impact in the affected areas.

According to a recent report by the Hawaii Tribune-Herald, the Hawaii State Energy Office is funding an effort to produce updated geothermal resource maps for multiple islands, including Hawaii Island, Maui, and Lanai. The data is expected to help reduce drilling risk and cost, as well as to improve investment confidence in new geothermal projects. The initiative is part of a broader push to diversify Hawaii’s clean energy portfolio and reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels. While Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) currently remains the only operational geothermal power plant in the state, producing up to 38 MW on Hawaii Island, other regions are being evaluated for new development opportunities. The administration is seeking support for around USD 80 million in funding for the next two years, with more likely later. **Aiming for energy resilience** Hawaii has set ambitious climate and energy goals, including achieving 100% renewable electricity by 2045. Geothermal energy – thanks to its firm, baseload nature – is viewed as a vital contributor to energy security, grid stability, and long-term sustainability. In addition to the state-led mapping program, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is undertaking its own geothermal resource assessment across the islands. These layered efforts are meant to overcome historical uncertainties around subsurface temperatures, permeability, and other geological factors that have long limited development. “There is enormous geothermal potential across Hawaii,” said State Energy Officer Mark Glick, who emphasized that improved resource data will help identify promising sites and streamline permitting processes. **Private sector readiness** Interest from private developers is also increasing. Ormat Technologies, owner and [operator of PGV](https://punageothermalproject.com/), has stated its intent to expand operations on the Big Island, while other firms are reportedly evaluating prospects on Maui and Lanai. The state’s only geothermal plant, PGV, [resumed operations in 2020](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/ormat-resumes-operation-of-the-puna-geothermal-power-plant-on-hawaii/) after a prolonged shutdown due to the 2018 eruption of Kilauea Volcano. The facility now plays a critical role in Hawaii Island’s grid and serves as a model for how geothermal can contribute to both climate targets and energy reliability. **For the geothermal sector** The recent developments in Hawaii reflect a renewed commitment to advancing geothermal as a strategic, low-emission power source. By combining public sector mapping and de-risking efforts with private investment and community engagement, the state is creating a more fertile ground for future projects.

Governor of Virginia Glenn Youngkin (R) has signed into law [Senate Bill 1316](https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB1316/id/3231370), which proposes to include geothermal energy as one of the eligible renewable technologies under the state’s Renewables Portfolio Standard. The bill was authored Senator Jeremy McPike (D). The Renewables Portfolio Standard, introduced in 2020 via House Bill 1526, established a mandatory renewable portfolio standard for electric utilities and suppliers in Virginia. The law mandates that Phase II utilities generate 100% of their power from renewable sources, and that Phase I utilities follow by 2050. With the amendment, utilities can now shift to “geothermal electric generating resources” to comply with the Renewables Portfolio Standard. It joins other renewable energy sources including solar and wind, waste-to-energy, hydropower, geothermal heating and cooling, and biomass. There was also a move to include nuclear under the renewable energy sources eligible under the standard, but this was rejected by members of the General Assembly. _“The geology of Virginia may not be perfect for [geothermal], but we want companies to explore it as a renewable source,”_ McPike says. _“And so, this is something that hasn’t been in the code. I think by adding it, it’s a signal that, ‘hey, we’re interested [in] adding it to our renewable portfolio standard.’”_ _“I’m very glad that the governor has been a leader in energy his administration. I think that’s one of his legacy points is energy planning,”_ said Thomas Turner, the Virginia state director of Conservatives for Clean Energy._“And I’m really thankful that he has embraced the all-of-the-above approach to energy, as many Republican governors have across the country.”_","Geothermal, Glenn Youngkin, Jeremy McPike, Legislation, portfolio, Renewable Portfolio Standards, Renewables, Virginia","Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin signed Senate Bill 1316, officially including geothermal energy as an eligible technology under the state's Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS). The legislation, authored by Senator Jeremy McPike, expands the RPS established in 2020 to allow utilities to use geothermal electric generating resources alongside solar, wind, hydropower, waste-to-energy, biomass, and geothermal heating and cooling. This move aims to diversify Virginia's renewable energy sources and signals government support for geothermal exploration, despite geological limitations. While nuclear energy was considered for inclusion, it was ultimately rejected by the General Assembly. The law mandates that by 2050, utilities must generate 100% of their electricity from renewable sources, with the inclusion of geothermal as a new option for compliance. This development reflects Virginia's broader energy transition strategy and encourages renewable diversification, potentially fostering geothermal research and investment in the state, even with challenging geological conditions. The legislation marks Virginia's ongoing commitment to expanding renewable options and aligns with broader U.S. trends toward an all-of-the-above energy approach.",Renewable energy; Geothermal energy

German Geothermal Association launches geothermal cooling campaign,Carlo Cariaga,19 Aug 2025,"The German Geothermal Association has launched a campaign promoting the use of geothermal energy for cooling - just in time for another very hot summer! Did you know that geothermal can also be a source for cooling? As summers get hotter and extreme weather events happen more frequently, geothermal can provide an energy source for countering heat stress without increasing CO2 emissions. This is the central message of a new campaign launched by the [German Geothermal Association](https://www.geothermie.de/) (Bundesverband Geothermie / BVG). The campaign, **“Staying cool is also possible with geothermal energy!”** highlights all the available technologies that can be used to harness geothermal energy for cooling, and the potential efficiency gains and cost reduction. As the BVG states, less than 10% of Germans know that geothermal energy can also be used for cooling. To promote awareness, the association prepared five short videos to demonstrate how geothermal is ideal for efficient and sustainable cooling of buildings and houses in summer, without the need for energy-hungry air conditioning systems. The short videos can be seen at the BVG’s social media channels – [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bundesverband-geothermie-e.v./?viewAsMember=true), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bundesverband_geothermie), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/p/Geothermie-100063860029676), and [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@bundesverband_geothermie?lang=de-DE).

As the geothermal sector gains momentum in the UK, it has also started expanding into different technologies and markets. From its rich history of shallow geothermal heating, the UK has now had success in developing mine water heating schemes and emerging projects are looking into geothermal power generation and lithium extraction. With now a more diversified and rapidly growing sector, the **[Geothermal UK](https://www.geothermaluk.org/)** coalition was launched [to give the industry a unified voice](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-coalition-launches-to-promote-and-unlock-uks-geothermal-potential/). Over the next few weeks, we will hear from some key UK industry players in the interview series:**‘Voices of Geothermal UK’.** UK developers, delivery experts and advisors will explain the opportunities they see for geothermal expansion in the UK, the challenges they are facing and the importance of collaboration to enable growth. We start off this series with **Anne Murrell** , Lead of the UK Geothermal Coalition, as she discusses the objectives of the coalition, its current standing, the its next steps in advocating for geothermal in the UK. Over the coming weeks, we will be publishing more interviews giving insights on the future of geothermal in the UK. Watch out for features on the following personalities: * Jordan Weddepohl, Arup * Tamsin Lishman, Kensa * Karen Spenley, Celsius Energy * David Townsend, TownRock Energy * Stuart Sinclair, Consortium Drilling * Gus Grand, Eden Geothermal Key industry stakeholders launched Geothermal UK earlier this year to address both the energy challenges and geothermal sector challenges in the UK. Firstly, the UK is facing**energy challenges** which geothermal can help to solve. These include the climate crisis and resulting need for decarbonisation, rising energy costs and widespread fuel poverty, the need for energy security, and grid capacity issues as we shift to renewables. The government’s target for the UK to become a ‘Clean Energy Superpower’ aims to tackle these challenges, and geothermal has a key role to play in this. Secondly, we are experiencing **geothermal industry challenges** as the sector beings to expand. We see growing momentum in specific areas and technologies, such as the deep geothermal projects in Cornwall, mine water projects in the North East, and city heat networks across the country. We need to optimise all this great work through national coordination, enabling strategic follow-through and the sharing of knowledge and experience. In summary, we need a unified voice to bring the industry together and engage policy: this is Geothermal UK. We want to establish geothermal as a mainstream part of the UK energy system, especially for clean heat. Geothermal UK will help to scale the sector responsibly and collaboratively. In practical terms we will support real project delivery, and we aim to become a trusted hub for all, including government, industry, local authorities and funders. We are an industry-led, UK-focused coalition, grounded in implementation. Our governance model, underpinned by a Charter, enables the credible, inclusive coordination of – and collaboration with – all stakeholders, whilst championing the unique UK geothermal brand. Other organisations have powerful lobbying roles to play, or they represent key stakeholder groups and companies, or have a specific technical focus. And there are international groups, enabling the sharing of learnings across borders, and also organisations representing renewables as a whole, within which geothermal needs to have a seat at the table. Geothermal UK wants to collaborate with these organisations, bringing together all the facets required to support the growth of our UK geothermal industry. Geothermal UK is a coalition of geothermal stakeholders and supporters with developers at its heart. Founding members include representatives of all geothermal technologies, our supply chain and other experts. We are currently volunteer-led, and formalisation of our structure is on the horizon. We welcome all who are aligned to our core principles to join the coalition, including industry, academics, customers, NGOs, funders and others. The first step is to sign the Charter (found on [www.geothermaluk.org](http://www.geothermaluk.org)), then participate in working groups as suits your interest, skill-set and time availability. The primary issue is lack of awareness of geothermal energy and its potential – within government, investors and the public. There is a lack of policy visibility and there are no dedicated support frameworks (permitting, regulation etc.). We need a national roadmap, integrating geothermal into our energy system. Our event calendar is pretty full over the next couple of months, including the next in our series of MP breakfasts in Parliament, industry/ government roundtables and investor events. We are also continuing our webinar series to inform and engage with our community. We are strengthening our working groups – policy, comms and funding – and making sure that geothermal energy in the UK is positioned prominently within broader discussions, at the same time as enhancing our strong, unique geothermal identity. Regarding the organisation itself, we are exploring fiscal hosting options and developing funding avenues to move from a volunteer-based structure to sustainable operations. Geothermal energy provides a proven, place-based and sustainable solution. It provides clean heat at scale, and can play a key role in Britain’s ambition to become a Clean Energy Superpower. Geothermal energy is underutilised in the UK and should have strategic focus within the UK energy system. Geothermal UK is a credible industry voice to inform and co-create impactful policy, and a powerful coalition to enable the delivery of geothermal solutions across the UK. Our earth has huge potential to fulfil our energy needs – let’s use it! If you believe that geothermal will play a vital role in the UK’s energy future, join us! Whether you’re a developer, policymaker, community leader, funder or engineer, Geothermal UK needs your input. Help us build the future of UK geothermal together.

Zanskar is the first AI-native geothermal company using AI to transform the discovery, assessment, and delivery of geothermal energy. With the resource confirmed via deep drilling, Zanskar will now move to full power development for the Pumpernickel site. The company will drill and construct production and injections wells and power plant, with the first phase of development expected to start delivering electricity to the grid within just three years. Following their [great success at the Lightning Dock geothermal field in New Mexico](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/zanskar-repowers-lightning-dock-geothermal-facility-in-new-mexico-to-full-capacity/), Zanskar set out to validate their AI-enabled modeling and targeting tools to explore the geothermal potential at a greenfield site. The Pumpernickel site, located at the Pumpernickel Valley, is described as having sparse data and much higher degree of uncertainty compared to Lightning Dock. Previous attempts at geothermal development at Pumpernickel have been documented [through](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/nevada-geothermal-power/) [the years](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/sierra-geothermal-power-drops-pumpernickel-option/). The stochastic reservoir modeling approach used in Lightning Dock was also used to plan the wells in Pumpernickel. Using the available legacy geologic data sets and shallow exploration wells, a range of geological scenarios was generated, which were the bases for the recommended drilling targets based on maximizing both temperature and permeability. The two best recommendations were used for well targeting. The first well encountered difficult drilling conditions related to hot and unstable formations. The second well reached the target depth, despite challenges in encountering multiple zones of total circulation loss. Despite difficulties in drilling, all these conditions are indicative of a hot and permeable geothermal system. Aside from encountering high temperatures at relatively shallow depth, the well also encountered multiple loss zones and artesian flow zones. The thick (>60 ft / 18 m) damage zones correlate to exceptional permeability. Based on heat-in-place calculations at <2 kilometers depth, the site can support a Phase 1 20-MWe development. The success at Pumpernickel proves that there are still greenfield sites in the USA that can be developed for power generation, even at sites where previous attempts have failed. The Pumpernickel site also proves that there is still untapped potential at hydrothermal or “conventional” geothermal resources in the USA, thus countering the perception that next-generation solutions like EGS are the only way to grow the industry. _“Our team’s ability to execute with these AI tools and precision drilling is unparalleled,”_ said Carl Hoiland, Co-founder and CEO at Zanskar. _“Our vertically-integrated, AI-native approach to geothermal development is delivering the speed to discovery and speed to development necessary to meet the new paradigm of rapid energy demand growth. These latest deep drilling results only further confirm what we’ve known all along: conventional geothermal resources are far more abundant and bigger than previously believed and are the lowest-cost route to delivering gigawatts of reliable, carbon-free, baseload power at scale.”_ Using artificial intelligence, advanced geoscience modeling, and modern data collection methods, Zanskar is aiming to make geothermal resource discovery faster, cheaper, and more scalable. Zanskar has already reduced discovery costs per MW by an order of magnitude compared to inflation-adjusted costs incurred by geothermal’s last major greenfield explorers. _“At Zanskar, our combination of modern, low-cost, field data collection and large compute geospatial models is proving that we can uncover geothermal resources others miss.”_ said Joel Edwards, Co-founder and CTO at Zanskar. _“But claiming a site has power potential is a lot easier than proving it with a drill bit. Pumpernickel is the latest example of when we go where our models tell us, we deliver, and we’re set up to do this over and over again.” ._","AI, conventional geothermal, Drilling, exploration, Geothermal, hydrothermal systems, Lightning Dock, modeling, Nevada, permeability, Pumpernickel, reservoir modeling, Zanskar, Zanskar Geothermal and Minerals","Zanskar, the first AI-native geothermal energy company, announced successful deep drilling at the Pumpernickel site in Nevada, confirming a geothermal resource suitable for a 20-MWe Phase 1 development.

A fantastic article written by Tom Ough for the think tank [Institute for Progress](https://ifp.org/) (IFP) closely examines the Utah FORGE projects, its history, results, and impact on the wider field of geothermal research and innovation. **[Read the original piece via this link.](https://ifp.org/why-forge-works/#industry-and-investor-response)** The funding opportunity for the Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) programme [was first announced back in 2014](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/doe-forge-webinar-slides-available/). The first phase of the project was the selection of the project site, of which [five candidates were considered](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/roadtrip-to-the-candidates-for-the-forge-geothermal-research-project-in-the-u-s/): California, Utah, Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon. The site near Milford in Beaver County, Utah was selected in 2018, after [some preliminary drilling](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/drilling-started-at-forge-geothermal-research-project-in-utah/) had been done. Led by the University of Utah’s Energy and Geoscience Institute, the USD 218 million budget of Utah FORGE lasted through mid-2024. FORGE had a small team led by Dr. Joseph Moore, working in partnership with private enterprise. The objective of the project is to reduce the cost of Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) by 90%, to USD45 per MWh by 2035. This was to be done by developing innovative drilling and reservoir stimulation techniques, as well as tools to establish well connectivity. We have reported extensively on the technical achievements of Utah FORGE [through the years](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/?s=forge). The project has increased its drilling speeds by fivefold, [demonstrated successful well connectivity](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/utah-forge-reports-successful-stimulation-and-circulation-at-egs-site/) through stage-wise stimulation, and has provided a test environment for high-temperature drilling equipment. Just as importantly, all of the technical data from the Utah FORGE project are [publicly accessible via the project Wiki page](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/utah-forge-publishes-wiki-dashboard-for-open-access-data/). Based on IFP’s research and interviews, there have been early signs of success on this front. The results of FORGE has benefited established geothermal players like Ormat Technologies and have been instrumental to the EGS efforts of Fervo Energy. The numbers are not quite there yet, as Fervo is selling electricity at USD 100 per MWh based on [a PPA with Southern California Edison.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/fervo-signs-320-mw-geothermal-ppa-with-california-utility/) However, another aspiration was for the Utah FORGE project to spur more investment into the geothermal sector. Despite all the progress that Utah FORGE has made, its USD 218 million budget is a fraction of investments in other next-generation energy technologies, such as carbon management (USD 7 billion), advanced nuclear (USD 3.3 billion), and hydrogen hubs (USD 8 billion). In recent years, there has been a growth in investor interest in various geothermal startups and ventures. A detailed discussion of this phenomenon will warrant its own article, but it suffices to say that geothermal companies have attracted investments from various sources including banks, institutional investors, venture capitalists, and private equity among others. While it would be a stretch to attribute all of the increased investment in the geothermal sector to the Utah FORGE project, there is no doubt that it has helped draw more attention from external stakeholders.","Beaver County, connectivity, Drilling, EGS, enhanced geothermal systems, Geothermal, investment, Joseph Moore, Milford, research, stimulation, US Department of Energy, Utah Forge","The Utah FORGE project, initiated in 2014 and located near Milford, Utah, represents a significant technological development in geothermal energy, with a USD 218 million budget managed by the University of Utah’s Energy and Geoscience Institute. Its primary goal is to reduce Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) costs by 90%, to USD 45 per MWh by 2035, through innovations in drilling, reservoir stimulation, and well connectivity. Achievements include a fivefold increase in drilling speed, successful well connectivity demonstrated via stage-wise stimulation, and the provision of open access to technical data, fostering transparency. The project has attracted collaborations with industry actors like Ormat Technologies and Fervo Energy, influencing their EGS efforts and commercial viability—Fervo’s current PPA prices (~USD 100 per MWh) highlight ongoing economic challenges. Although Utah FORGE has advanced geothermal technical capabilities and boosted sector interest, its funding remains modest relative to other energy technology investments (e.g., carbon management, nuclear, hydrogen). Nonetheless, the project has contributed to increasing investor interest and sector visibility, signaling potential for future growth and deployment in geothermal energy.",Geothermal energy; Energy efficiency; Climate finance

A seismic data acquisition campaign had recently been done in the city of Aix-en-Provence in Southern France as part of exploration efforts for potential deep geothermal resource utilization. The survey covered the streets of both Éguilles and Aix-en-Provence to collect seismic data which will help characterize and identify subsurface geological layers. The city of Aix-en-Provence is exploring the possibility of deep geothermal to decarbonize its existing heating network, which currently already provides 28,000 residents with heating and domestic hot water. Currently, renewable energy in Aix-en-Provence is exclusively supplied by biomass. The city would like to diversify this, while also increasing the renewable energy rate to 87%. The city has entrusted [ENGIE Solutions](https://www.engie.com/en/engie-solutions-support) with the task of both decarbonizing and expanding its heating network. If the results of exploration efforts are positive, boreholes of up to 2 kilometers depth will be drilled and are expected to extract water at temperatures of around 70 °C. The geothermal heating plant is scheduled to be operational in 2028, and will be located in Constance. Matthieu Fuentes, Project Manager at ENGIE Solutions, pointed out that the energy mix of biomass and geothermal will be alternated according to the seasons. During the summer period, geothermal alone should be able to meet the heating needs. Thus, there will no longer be any emissions from natural gas during summer. Majority of the geothermal installations in France are around the Île-de-France region. Geothermal development in Aix-en-Provence may open up an entirely new region for geothermal growth in France, further solidifying its position in the field of geothermal heating. **[RELATED: France finalizes action plan for geothermal sector development](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/france-finalizes-action-plan-for-geothermal-sector-development/)**","Aix-en-Provence, Biomass, district heating, exploration, France, Geothermal, Geothermie, Seismic survey","A seismic data acquisition campaign was conducted in Aix-en-Provence, Southern France, as part of an exploration initiative to assess deep geothermal potential for district heating.

The geothermal project will be headed by [Amperland Thermalwärme GmbH](https://www.amperland-thermalwaerme.de/) (ATW), a subsidiary of [Joint Municipal Company for Waste Management](https://www.gfa-online.com/) (Gemeinsames Unternehmen für Abfallwirtschaft / GfA), the company that currently operates the waste-to-energy plant. The plan is to drill a doublet that taps into the water-bearing layer of the Upper Jurassic aquifer at a depth of approximately 1,725 ??meters. Water temperature at this depth is expected to be about 73 °C. If the drilling and well testing results are positive, the company will then apply for a water law permit. The geothermal heating plant can then be operational by early 2027. Available seismic and drilling data was requested by ATW from the Bavarian State Office for the Environment. This data was then used to model subsurface structures and help identify the drilling targets. [The permit for drilling](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/waste-incineration-firm-in-olching-germany-to-drill-for-geothermal-heating/) was granted in later 2024. The geothermal project in Geiselbullach is supported by the Federal Funding for Efficient Heat Networks” (BEW) program of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection (BMWK), which provides a 40% investment subsidy for generation facilities and infrastructure. The combination of the construction of a geothermal plant and the expansion of the heat supply qualifies ATW for this funding.",,"In Geiselbullach, Bavaria, Germany, drilling for a geothermal doublet is scheduled to commence by December 2025, aiming to supply heat to an existing waste-to-energy facility operated by Amperland Thermalwärme GmbH (ATW), a subsidiary of the Joint Municipal Company for Waste Management (GfA).

The newly published**[“Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2024”](https://www.irena.org/Publications/2025/Jun/Renewable-Power-Generation-Costs-in-2024)** document by the [International Renewable Energy Agency](https://www.irena.org/) (IRENA) reports that the global weighted average Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for geothermal power generation has dropped by 16%, from USD 0.072/kWh to **0.060/kWh**. Although undoubtedly a positive development, this figures comes close to the 2022 value (USD 0.059/kWh) and is within the range of average LCOE values for the past 5 years (USD 0.059/kWh to USD 0.075/kWh) Compared to other renewables, geothermal power has a higher weighted average LCOE than hydropower (USD 0.057/kWh), solar PV (USD 0.043/kWh), and onshore wind (USD 0.034/kWh). However, LCOE values for concentrated solar power (CSP) (USD 0.092/kWh), bioenergy (USD 0.087/kWh), and offshore wind (USD 0.079/kWh) are still higher than geothermal. For the year 2024, LCOE values ranged from a high of USD 0.090 kWh (Indonesia) to as low as USD 0.033/kWh (Türkiye). The drop in the global weighted average LCOE was heavily influenced by the Tauhara II project, primarily driven by a lower Total Installed Cost for geothermal power in New Zealand. Given the unique nature of geothermal systems across different markets and geologies, geothermal power does not have the same standardized cost structures as that of onshore wind or solar PV. Geothermal power project costs are heavily influenced by reservoir quality, directly determining costs associated with drilling (including depth and number of wells) and power plant technology. Geothermal projects also have a very different risk profile, as the resource quality cannot be determined unless capital-intensive drilling has been done. The figure above succinctly shows this trend, with different regions having markedly different LCOE and TIC values for geothermal power. Capital costs for Indonesia were significantly higher than other regions, likely brought about by large-scale drilling and exploration campaigns. The drop for Türkiye was also significant, but currency exchange rate trends must be factored in analyzing this trend, particularly when all figures are expressed as USD. LCOE trends closely follow the TIC trends. However, O&M costs for geothermal can also be high because of make-up drilling, especially when the goal is to maintain high Capacity Factors (CF). The O&M cost assumption applied for projects commissioned in 2024 was USD 125/kW per year and USD 110/kW per year for projects deployed between 2010 and 2023. TIC and LCOE trends tend to fluctuate heavily year-to-year owing to the small number of geothermal power facilities that go online on any single year. This can make analysis of global trends complicated and potentially misleading. Thus, the situation warrants a closer look at local and regional factors that influence development costs. At an average of 88% for the year 2024, a high capacity factor remains one of the greatest strengths of geothermal over other forms of renewable power. This figure also went up by 7% from 2023. Average CFs for geothermal power have remained competitive since 2010, with values ranging from 77% to 88%. Compared to other renewables, geothermal power facilities are designed to operate most of the year and are not influenced by weather conditions or day-night cycles. There are still some variations in CF from one region to another due to resource quality, reservoir dynamics, and economic factors. **Technological trends provide optimism** The emergence of so-called “next-generation” technologies is giving plenty of optimism for geothermal power to grow beyond its current scope. Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) and Advanced Geothermal Systems (AGS) are striving to make geothermal power development possible in areas and regions previously not considered viable under the conventional geothermal method. Superhot geothermal seeks to increase the productivity of geothermal wells by tapping into much hotter resources. Such pioneering methods have also served as testing grounds for work to reduce drilling costs and improve stimulation methods. There are also efforts to pair geothermal with other renewables, potentially acting as energy storage for intermittent renewable energy sources like solar and wind. The geothermal industry continues to await the commercial-scale deployment of these next-generation technologies, with Fervo Energy and Eavor Technologies as some of the companies leading the way. Continued innovation and government support remain key factors to realizing the potential of such technologies. Overall, 2024 was a breakthrough year for renewable with an unprecedented 582 GW of new capacity addition. Solar PV contributed greatly to this surge, accounting for 77.8% of the total new capacity. On a per-country basis, China accounted for 61.2% of global solar PV additions and 69.4% of new wind installations. Although the total installed renewable power capacity reached 4,442 GW in 2024, this is still far from the target of 11,000+ GW by 2030 which was [agreed upon at COP28](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/the-cop28-pledge-to-triple-up-by-2030-and-implications-for-geothermal/). The growth of geothermal power has remained near-constant in 2024. Work being done in emerging markets (such as the Caribbean and Canary Islands), continued growth in the Pacific and East African regions, and technological innovations (including superhot geothermal and deep drilling technologies) are paving the way for exponential growth in the coming years.

A version from a geologist’s perspective,Luis C-A. Gutiérrez Negrín,23 May 2025,"In this guest article, Luis C-A. Gutiérrez Negrín responds to the ownership issue of geothermal heat and sheds light on other issues holding back the industry. Alex Richter[ wrote an interesting commentary in ThinkGeoEnergy ](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-legal-study-asks-who-owns-geothermal-heat/)about the scholar article[ **“Who Owns Heat? Property Rights in Geothermal Energy”**](https://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Eckstein.pdf) authored by Professor Gabriel Eckstein of Texas A&M School of Law, and recently published in the University of Illinois Law Review, Vol. 2025, pp. 492-553. Eckstein introduces the subject in the very first lines of his foreword, mentioning that landowners in the US –and some other countries– _“can have ownership claims to oil, gas, water, and other tangible natural resources located in their subsoil. But can they also claim rights to the thermal energy found below their land?”_ So, as Richter remarks,_“Eckstein argues that the law remains largely unsettled when it comes to thermal energy.”_ In addition, Eckstein refers to geothermal energy as _“an incorporeal, uncontainable, natural resource that is better defined as a characteristic of underground formations rather than as a physical or tangible thing”_ and, as Richter mentions in his commentary, _“Geothermal energy is not a substance like water or minerals—it’s a condition or characteristic of subsurface formations.”_ Eckstein considers there are ambiguities _“in property rights related to the development and ownership of geothermal energy resources”_ (in the US), and then it is not clearly stated _“who is entitled to benefit from”_ (them). Therefore, writes Richter, _“the absence of clear legal ownership could hinder geothermal development in the United States.”_ In Eckstein’s opinion, _“the lack of clarity in property rights related to the development and ownership of geothermal energy resources_ ” is a barrier to the development of geothermal in the US,_“possibly more pernicious”_ than other well-known barriers like high upfront costs, technological limitations, and relatively high energy production costs. Eckstein concludes his long and very well documented study writing that is necessary to establish _“a property regime for geothermal energy resources,”_ which must be _“consistent not only within states, but across the nation,”_ and announces a _“follow-up article”_ where he will present his best approach to this subject. I will look forward to that new article, but in the meantime, I must confess I do not understand why this legal conundrum exists in the US. I am a geologist, not a lawyer –like Eckstein and Richter–, but in my opinion geothermal energy it is not really _“a condition or characteristic of subsurface formations,”_ but a specific type of energy –thermal energy–, that can be harvested with proper equipment and tools –like geothermal wells. It is certainly _“an incorporeal, uncontainable, natural resource”_ and therefore it is not _“a physical or tangible thing.”_ But more than _“a characteristic of underground formations”_ geothermal resources are simply thermal energy of the Earth, that can be naturally concentrated by fluids in some parts of the subsurface, called hydrothermal systems or reservoirs, or diffused in the rocks. Thermal energy is also produced by the sun and can be harvested by superficial thermo-solar installations located on a private or public land, whose owner is entitled to benefit from the thermal energy of the sun collected within the limits of their property. The landowner also can get benefit from the wind blowing on their property, by installing the proper towers and wind-turbines to generate electricity, and from the sunlight by installing solar panels able to transform the sunlight in electricity through the photo-electric effect. Sunlight, solar heat, and wind are also incorporeal, uncontainable, and natural resources, whose logical beneficiary is anyway the owner of the superficial land where the proper installations are installed. Subsurface thermal energy –or geothermal energy– produced by radioactive decay of some minerals or as residue of the planet formation 4.5 billion years ago, must be in a similar situation of legal ownership. Nothing more, but nothing less. In other countries, like Mexico, whose constitutional system is based on the Roman droit, all the subsurface resources are an original property of the nation, who can grant the use, exploitation, and/or benefit of those resources to particulars during certain time and/or under certain conditions. There, it is clear than any sort of energy or material resource with some intrinsic or extrinsic commercial value, including simple rocks for quarry, are property of the person that holds the proper titles, licenses, or permits issued by the federal government on behalf of the nation –which is not necessarily the same landowner. Thus, in countries with constitutional systems based on Anglo-Saxon droit, the question about who owns the subsurface heat should be enough clear, since the original ownership corresponds to the first person that claimed the land (first in place, first in right), and not from an entelechy called the nation. However, as Eckstein remarks, there are many different interpretations and requirements to grant geothermal licenses or permits among the fifty states of the union, and even among counties, because the general concept is one thing, but the practical specificities are other. One obvious way to overcome that, is proposing a federal law on geothermal resources, to uniformize all the particularities not only about ownership but also about regulations. Of course, there is the [Geothermal Steam Act](https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media_wysiwyg/geothermal-steam-act-of-1970.pdf) (GSA), but I understand it has a limited scope since it is focused on geothermal resources located in federal lands managed by the [Bureau of Land Management](https://www.blm.gov/d8-home) (BLM). There are also geothermal laws in several countries in the world, even in some countries with no current geothermal use at all –like Ethiopia. One of the countries with geothermal specific law is Mexico, whose original act (LEG: Ley de Energía Geotérmica) was passed in 2014, and now [there is a new Geothermal Law](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/mexican-president-proposes-revamped-geothermal-law-as-part-of-energy-reforms/) (LG: Ley de Geotermia), which focuses on geothermal resources for electricity generation, passed in March 2025. Thus, contrarily to the case of the US, as presented by Eckstein, the slow geothermal development in Mexico has not been due to ambiguities in the ownership of the resource, or to the lack of a geothermal act, but for the usual hurdles: high upfront costs, more risks in the exploration stage, relatively high levelized costs, and technological limitations… In any case, having a geothermal law is an advantage.

Gutiérrez-Negrín, Mexico, ownership, regulation, United States, USA","A recent legal review highlights the unresolved ownership rights to geothermal heat in the United States, emphasizing that current property law does not clearly define whether landowners can claim rights to geothermal thermal energy beneath their land. Professor Gabriel Eckstein of Texas A&M Law underscores that geothermal energy is characterized more as a natural, incorporeal trait of subsurface formations rather than a tangible substance, complicating property rights. This ambiguity presents significant barriers to geothermal industry development, potentially more restrictive than high costs or technological challenges. Unlike countries such as Mexico, which have enacted specific geothermal legislations establishing national ownership rights, the US lacks a comprehensive federal framework, with existing laws like the Geothermal Steam Act limited to federal lands. Expert opinions suggest that establishing a uniform federal property regime could alleviate legal uncertainties, accelerating geothermal resource deployment. This issue is particularly pertinent given the global interest in sustainable energy sources and the need for clear legal structures to promote geothermal innovation and investment. The discussion is situated within ongoing energy law reforms and international comparative contexts, emphasizing the importance of legal clarity for geothermal sector growth.",Geothermal energy

The results of the GeoCOOL Food project were recently presented to the public, providing initial guidelines on the use of geothermal energy for agricultural cold storage in Slovenia. The study indicates that the potential exists, but factors can vary greatly such as the solutions cannot be standard and that economic viability must be assessed for each project. The GeoCOOL Food project, which started in 2022, aimed to examine the possibilities of using shallow geothermal for storing and cooling of food in small agricultural food stores. The study was done by experts from the [Geological Survey of Slovenia](https://www.geo-zs.si/en/), the [Jozef Stefan Institute](https://www.ijs.si/ijsw/JSI), and the [Biotechnical Faculty of the University of Ljubljana](https://www.bf.uni-lj.si/en/). As part of the studies, a 100-meter deep research well was built in a pilot farm in Podbo?je where optical cables for temperature monitoring were installed. According to Nina Rman, Project Manager at the Geological Survey of Slovenia, this was the first time that shallow geothermal energy was used for agriculture in Slovenia. _“We know that geothermal is already being used to heat three greenhouses. However, we have not yet registered any use for cold storage facilities.”_ Rajko Vidrih from the Faculty of Biotechnology stated that storing produce in cold conditions extends their shelf life and helps maintain good quality._“This is important from both nutritional and economic perspectives.”_ Based on the study results, the use of shallow geothermal energy for cooling is possible but the costs make it economically viable only in specific cases. Gašper Stegnar from the Jožef Stefan Institute emphasized that such applications require large investment, but the energy savings can be quite small. Thus, grants would be instrumental in helping deploy such technologies more widely. _“For successful use, we need an overview of energy consumption on the farm, appropriate geological data and, above all, balanced use for heating and cooling. Only in this way can the soil serve as an effective heat and cold storage,”_ added Jorg Prestor from the Geological Survey. Part of the output of the study is a model for assessing the economic viability of geothermal-based cold storage, as well as the first technological guidance for the use of shallow geothermal energy for Slovenian cold storage facilities. _“We found that the potential exists, but the solutions cannot be standard. This is now a matter for the competent ministry and the interests of farmers, who need guidelines,”_ concluded Rman. **[RELATED: Himachal Pradesh, India to set up geothermal controlled atmosphere storage](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/himachal-pradesh-india-to-set-up-geothermal-controlled-atmosphere-storage/)**","Agriculture, cooling, GeoCOOL Food, Geological Survey of Slovenia, Geothermal, Jozef Stefan Institute, Podbo?je, research, shallow geothermal, Slovenia, University of Ljubljana","A 2023 Slovenian study, part of the GeoCOOL Food project, evaluated the technical and economic feasibility of utilizing shallow geothermal energy for agricultural cold storage.

The company, formed only seven years ago, is on track to prove that clean, renewable geothermal energy could power the world, according to Carlos Araque, CEO of [Quaise](https://www.quaise.energy/) and a co-founder. “Geothermal energy is available everywhere on massive scales,” said Araque. “If you take all fossil, all nuclear, and all other forms of renewable energy combined, they’re not even a millionth of a millionth of the thermal stores of energy” below the Earth’s surface. “It’s mind-boggling, and to get it, we only have to go down two to twelve miles. That’s how close we are to infinite clean energy no matter where you are in the world.” Araque was speaking on May 21 at the first demonstration of the company’s drilling technology at a full-scale oil rig owned by Nabors, one of the world’s largest oil-and-gas drilling companies. Among the approximately 50 attendees, who included reporters, potential investors, and even potential Quaise customers, was William Restrepo, CFO of [Nabors](https://www.nabors.com/our-company/) and a Quaise board member. Also on hand was Lauren Boyd, director of the [Geothermal Technologies Office at the U.S. Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/geothermal-technologies-office?nrg_redirect=267352). **Superhot, Superdeep** Geothermal energy–the heat beneath our feet–has been around for a long time, but it barely contributes to today’s energy mix. “That’s because the true geothermal resource, the one that matters, is not very accessible. Getting to it is beyond the economic reach of the conventional tool set of oil and gas,” said Araque. The [mother lode](https://www.quaise.energy/news/deep-geothermal-energy-lifes-origin-future) of geothermal energy is some two to 12 miles beneath the Earth’s surface where the rock is so hot that if water could be pumped to the area it would become supercritical, a steam-like phase that most people aren’t familiar with. (Familiar phases are liquid water, ice, and the vapor that makes clouds.) Supercritical water, in turn, can carry some 5-10 times more energy than regular hot water, making it an extremely efficient energy source if it could be pumped above ground to turbines that could convert it into electricity. Today we can’t access those resources, except in places like Iceland where they are relatively close to the surface. The number one problem: we can’t drill down far enough. The drills used by the oil and gas industries can’t withstand the formidable temperatures and pressures that are found miles down without becoming exponentially more expensive with depth. **Steady Progress** The May demo at the Nabors facility is only the latest of many in what Araque calls an aggressive timeline to prove the technology. The ultimate goal, he said, is to provide a renewable source of energy on parity with oil and gas. “This is not a company built to develop a cool drilling gadget. We aim to become a geothermal developer. Our product is not a drill bit. Our product is clean heat and energy that is abundant, reliable and affordable on a global scale,” said Araque. The general technique behind the Quaise drilling approach was developed at [MIT over some 15 years](https://news.mit.edu/2022/quaise-energy-geothermal-0628). Scientists there showed that millimeter waves could indeed drill a hole in basalt (basalt and granite make up the majority of rock at great depth). This was promising in part because the gyrotron machine that produces the millimeter-wave energy is not new. It’s been used for some 70 years in research toward nuclear fusion as an energy source. Quaise has been developing the technique to drill deeper and deeper holes. The holes drilled at MIT were two inches in diameter by two inches deep. Outside the Quaise lab in Houston earlier this year, engineers succeeded in drilling a hole four inches in diameter and 10 feet deep ([see video](https://www.quaise.energy/news/from-lab-to-field-testing)). Andres Calabressi, Head of Manufacturing at Quaise, emceed the Quaise demonstration with a microphone to communicate over the steady rumble of powerful equipment. He explained that beginning in March, the company lowered columns of granite about nine inches in diameter into a conventionally drilled hole under the rig. Together those columns made a core some 80 feet long that sits inside a metal casing. The latter is outfitted with ports to monitor parameters like heat and pressure, data that allow the team to test recipes for optimal drilling. The Quaise engineers then integrated the [millimeter-wave technology](https://www.quaise.energy/news/millimeter-wave-drilling-the-key-to-clean-energy-abundance) with the rig. In the May 21 demo, they shot millimeter waves into the granite column, deepening a hole four inches in diameter that they’d already drilled to ten feet. (The next week, the team successfully drilled to 30 feet for the first time; the next goal on this phase of the work is 40 feet.) During the demonstration, Calabressi was flanked by three large flat screens showing different dimensions of the work. One tracked key parameters like rock temperature, while another showed a video close-up of the millimeter waves melting rock. (The latter was taken previously in the Quaise lab since those interactions were not visible at the Nabors rig.) Araque noted that the demo was “full scale in size, but not in power.” The gyrotron involved produced 100 kilowatts of power. “That’s a tenth of the power that will be commercially relevant, and is roughly equivalent to the power of the car you drove to this demonstration.” Next month, Quaise expects the delivery of a much larger gyrotron capable of producing one megawatt of power. “That is commercially relevant. We aim to get it to the field over the next two years,” Araque said. In the meantime, the company is preparing for another demonstration planned for July in Marble Falls, Texas. There, the team aims to drill multiple holes 130 meters (about 425 feet) deep into an actual granite outcrop for the first time. Henry Phan is Vice President of Engineering at Quaise. He explained that the Marble Falls rig will be smaller, “allowing us to be more nimble in terms of moving from one hole to another.” **Additional Advances** Quaise has also been tackling other [scientific and engineering challenges](https://www.quaise.energy/news/international-multidisciplinary-collaborations-key-to-bringing-superhot-clean-geothermal-energy-to-the-world-2) associated with harvesting the energy from superhot, superdeep rock. Trenton Cladouhos, vice president of geothermal resource development at Quaise, described several of those challenges and advances toward solving them in a talk the day before the Quaise demo at a recent geothermal event in Houston. Cladouhos said that Quaise is working with vendors and universities “to push them to consider higher and higher temperatures.” For example, last year a team at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédéral de Lausanne reported new insights into what happens when superhot, superdeep rock is exposed to water that can eventually transfer the rocks’ heat to the surface. The work, supported in part by Quaise, was published in the journal Nature Communications. It confirmed earlier modeling work also supported by Quaise. In addition, Cladouhos noted that Quaise has an in-house engineer who has been working on the design of superhot geothermal power plants. Earlier this year Senior Mechanical Engineer Daniel Dichter [reported insights to that end](https://www.quaise.energy/news/quaise-energy-reports-new-insights-into-designing-superhot-geothermal-plants) in two papers. **Toward the Future** Araque concluded his presentation at the demo by describing the company’s blueprint for developing a superhot, superdeep geothermal resource available around the globe. It involves dividing the world into three tiers based on geothermal gradient, or how close the resource is to the surface. Tier 1, for example, will focus on relatively accessible superhot rock. This means that the first Quaise power plant will probably be located in the American West, perhaps near the Newberry Volcano site in Oregon. Newberry has a long history of geothermal exploration. Although still a ways off, Tier III sites, which will involve drilling as much as 12 miles down, “hold the key to making superhot geothermal a truly global energy source,” according to this [Quaise video](https://www.quaise.energy/news/tiers-of-development). “Tier III sites could provide power to more than 90% of humanity.” **Superhot Team** Araque described Quaise’s goal of unlocking superhot, superdeep energy for the world as “a moonshot. But it is not a moonshot.” The people working to “pioneer this transformative approach to clean energy have transitioned from careers in oil, gas, nuclear fission, and nuclear fusion,” and all have histories of achievement. For example, several were involved in the invention and development of [Manara](https://www.slb.com/products-and-services/innovating-in-oil-and-gas/completions/well-completions/intelligent-completions/downhole-interval-control-valves/manara-electric-interval-control-valves), a production and reservoir management solution developed at Schlumberger to substantially increase the recovery of oil from complex production systems. And among them, Quaise team members hold several patents. “So I’m confident that together we can make this work,” Araque concludes.","demo, Geothermal, milimeter wave, Quaise Energy, Technology","Quaise Energy has demonstrated a full-scale drilling test in Texas using advanced millimeter-wave technology to access superhot, superdeep geothermal resources, marking a significant step toward commercializing clean geothermal energy globally. The demonstration, performed on a Nabors oil rig, involved drilling a 4-inch diameter borehole to 30 feet; future plans aim to reach 40 feet, with a larger gyrotron capable of 1 megawatt soon to enable deeper drilling. The technology, developed over 15 years at MIT, involves using millimeter waves to melt rock, a method promising to withstand the high temperatures and pressures found 2-12 miles beneath Earth's surface—areas currently inaccessible with conventional drills. Quaise's goal is to develop geothermal power at scale, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and providing abundant, reliable energy worldwide. The company advances scientific understanding of superhot rock behavior and is planning a pilot project in Marble Falls, Texas, to drill deeper into actual granite formations.

artificial-lift-technology-helps-unlock-the-full-potential-of-geothermal-water-extraction.md,https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/artificial-lift-technology-helps-unlock-the-full-potential-of-geothermal-water-extraction/,Artificial lift technology helps unlock the full potential of geothermal water extraction,Carlo Cariaga,1 May 2025,"Modular designs, machine learning, and real-time performance monitoring are helping to tackle the challenges of ESP technology in geothermal settings. _Electrical submersible pump (ESP) technology has played a big role in expanding the utilization of geothermal resources worldwide, particularly for direct heating applications. However, the extreme conditions of geothermal environments introduce challenges to ESP design and operations. Efficiency, operations, and maintenance factors also have to be considered to maximize the economics of geothermal projects involving ESPs._ _In this guest article written by Hans Sjerps, Frank Corredor, Juan Pablo Atencia, and Alasdair McPhail, we go over the many common technical challenges of ESP operations and how[Halliburton](https://www.halliburton.com/) addresses these through tailor-made solutions._ In the 1990s, geothermal operators discovered the benefits of electric submersible pumps (ESPs), an artificial lift technology, for geothermal water extraction. These pumps, tried and proven in the oilfield to maximize hydrocarbon extraction, drew upon established techniques to remove subsurface fluids, which made them attractive to smaller-scale operations such as local heating networks and wellness baths. As geothermal operators pushed the limits of traditional applications and began exploring deeper depths, ESP use expanded to handle more significant outputs of up to 150 liters per second and withstand temperatures of 150°C. However, traditional ESPs hit their limits in geothermal applications. Extreme temperatures, corrosive brines, and strenuous operating conditions pose challenges and require operators to seek hardier solutions. The fluid extracted from geothermal wells lacks oil, which affects lubrication. Limestone-derived calcium carbonates could also cause scaling in essential pump and seal areas. While traditional high-flow ESP pumps perform well in standard water lifting, they risk potential failure under these intense geothermal conditions. In seasonal temperature changes, motor bearings and power connectors may experience even more stress that could cause failure. The geothermal industry originally adapted bolted bowl-type pumps, which originated from shallow cold water lifting applications. However, their limitations and safety concerns meant the industry required a new solution to withstand the demands of deep-set geothermal applications. Otherwise, operators could experience equipment failures due to the pressure, temperature, and vibrations inherent in geothermal wells. A notable incident with a customer in Europe highlighted the risks inherent in bolted bowl-type pumps. When a pump failed on site, the operator lost equipment downhole. Upon further inspection, the operator discovered vibrations due to the pressure in the well dislodging the downhole-facing bolts and cracking the bowls due to metal fatigue. This underscored the dangers of using pumps not designed for the conditions of deep geothermal wells. Geothermal projects require the utmost efficiency to help ensure a return on investment. However, traditional geothermal systems often use technology better suited to the oilfield, which results in less efficiency. For example, conventional geothermal systems use round power cables to maintain balanced electromagnetic fields, which prolongs submersible motors’ longevity and efficiency. However, these round cables occupy double the space compared to flat cables. With a frequency controller integrated into the ESP to correct imbalances caused by flat cables, operators can optimize the space and save power, reducing costs. Thermal cycling and scale resistance also increase costs for geothermal operators during geothermal fluid extraction. Traditional pump inlets often obstruct fluid movement, which results in cavitation and scale formation due to pressure drops. A larger inflow area for ESPs than standard intakes can address the issue of high flow rates in small casing sizes and help lower costs. Another way to reduce costs involves the reduction of the lifting requirement. Traditional intake design requires up to 50 kW more power to lift and meet high geothermal flow demands. However, a reduction of 2-bars at a flow rate of 400 m3/h (111 L/s necessitates 45 kW less lifting power applied at the surface. Calculated at €0.30 per kWh over a year, this equates to about €128,000 saved per year. In addition, geothermal operations encompass power generation and [direct heating,](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/french-cities-to-expand-geothermal-district-heating-network/) which demand versatile flow rates with seasonal variations in heat demand. Operators could reduce costs through a device integrated into the ESP that fine-tunes motor settings to suit load condition fluctuations, a capability beyond the reach of conventional frequency drive controllers. Field trials for these devices demonstrated up to 50 kW in achieved power savings for a 1650 HP motor at 40 Hz, compared to the maximum speed of 60 Hz, which translates to an estimated annual power cost reduction of around €130,000. Project economics, pump performance, and overall operation uptime benefit from real-time observation. They allow operators to detect abnormal events early to prevent a shutdown. SCADA platforms for real-time monitoring must include high-resolution data collection, visualization dashboards, key performance indicator measurement, and remote controls within a 24/7/365 cloud-based environment to ensure that data remains available and secured via private VPN-encrypted communications. The cloud-based environment facilitates monitoring and management regardless of location and/or mobile device. Without these features, operators will fall short of their objectives and cannot enable continuous real-time monitoring and management of geothermal plants and ESP systems. Machine learning algorithms and techniques further enhance ESP operations. They serve as advanced engineering tools for baseline conditions related to flow, pressure, and temperature that elevate the online platform’s data comparison features. Through these data analysis and processing advancements, the geothermal industry can now use pump performance tracking and well inflow performance monitoring. It also allows the establishment of power consumption benchmarks and prevents electromechanical anomalies. Furthermore, machine learning provides virtual parameters with less than 5% error margins compared to actual downhole gauges. Virtual sensors, combined with the physical sensor downhole, could, for example, detect a pump inlet plugging to schedule maintenance. The virtual sensors can take over for data reporting to the mining authorities without the need to pull a still-running pumping system in case the physical sensor fails. Dedicated surveillance engineers perform data analysis, pump health assessments, and ESP trend analysis within the platform. They base their analysis on a geothermal plant-specific operations playbook of best practices and historical events, which allows for the consistent execution of technical recommendations and the preservation of system integrity for operational scenarios. The collaborative efforts between operators and monitoring services, supported by digital and analytical tools, extend the operational runtime of ESPs. To meet the challenges of harsh geothermal environments, operators require ESPs that can withstand the demands of deep geothermal wells and tackle issues such as lubrication, scaling, and thermal stress. When [Halliburton](https://www.halliburton.com/) engineers developed the [GeoESP® pump system](https://www.halliburton.com/en/resources/geoesp-brochure), they began with a framework that accounted for geothermal environments and prioritized safety, flexibility, and efficiency. The GeoESP system emerged as a versatile, modular, and robust technology suite that consists of the GeoESP pump and related components: the GeoESP intake, GeoESP box test container, GeoController® surface package, and GeoESP skid. These modules work with the Intelevate™ digital platform to help operators adapt to various geothermal environments, maximize geothermal water extraction, and minimize input power costs. From its inception, engineers designed the GeoESP pump to help overcome the limitations and safety issues associated with the bolted-bowl pumps commonly used in the water-lifting industry. The redesign includes additional housing for the bowls to prevent lateral movements from long tubing risers that could lead to metal fatigue, which results in dislodged bolts. The pump housings can withstand differential pressures up to 193 bar—far beyond the requirements of geothermal applications. Moreover, flanged connections with upward-facing bolts with a centralizer ring secure the pump stages, reducing the risk of loose bolts. Because engineers designed the GeoESP system as a modular solution, operators can use pre-defined configurations with five, seven, 11, or 14 pump stages to handle flow rates from 20 to 160 liters per second. The standard outer diameter of 9.5 inches grants the GeoESP system the adaptability to handle various well inflow conditions. It simplifies the adaptation process at the well site for a range of flow rates and lifting requirements. It also ensures compatibility with a single set of centralizers for all pump configurations. For customers with multiple wells, standardization also helps them reduce the amount of inventory to a single GeoESP system. Halliburton builds GeoESP system components with high-quality, heat-resistant (150-250?C, 303-482?F BHT) materials that resist scale, corrosion, and abrasion with additional new and innovative technologies to address the unique demands of geothermal applications. These modular components enhance safety and reduce power input costs, as well as improve efficiency at geothermal well sites: * **GeoESP intake:** deep set ESPs must handle high flow rates from small casing diameters, but small intake sizes can pose a challenge. In addition, traditional pump inlets often obstruct fluid movement, which may lead to cavitation and scale formation due to pressure drops. The GeoESP intake, an easy-to-change, interchangeable, modular pump intake, drew inspiration from cross-industry designs like medical technology. The system boasts a 500% larger inflow area than standard intakes, with pressure loss reductions by over 30% for flow rates of around 10 liters per second. It features a screened housing to protect against small-sized solids and debris. Optimized inflow geometry reduces pressure drop for increased energy savings and further mitigates the development of scale and casing erosion around the pump inlet. * **GeoESP box test container:** A simple, 2000 kVA plug-and-play surface solution for inflow performance tests helps operators save time and money. The GeoESP box test container can also be used as a final, long-term solution that could save well costs related to surface plant construction, project engineering, and time to operation. * **GeoController surface package:** Geothermal operations encompass power generation and direct heating. The operations demand versatile flow rates due to seasonal variations in heat demand. The GeoESP system now includes the GeoController surface package. This device fine-tunes the GeoESP motor settings to suit load condition fluctuations, a capability beyond the reach of conventional frequency drive controllers. Field trials demonstrated that the GeoController surface package can achieve up to 50 kW in power savings for a 1650HP motor at 40Hz, compared to the maximum speed of 60Hz. This translates to an estimated annual power cost reduction of €130,000. The GeoController surface package facilitates seamless communication between various systems, with efficient data processing, real-time sensor monitoring, and remote interventions for advanced GeoESP operations, protections, and optimized power consumption. * **GeoESP skid:** Designed to increase the safety and speed of ESP execution, the GeoESP skid safeguards GeoESP equipment amid storage, transportation, and well-site preparation. It resists bending and impact, and provides safer built-in design features. The GeoESP skid helps the ESP arrive at the well-site ready for assembly and decreases the personnel required to handle and lift. One person can prepare rig-up without a forklift or crane for additional assistance. The GeoESP skid simplifies long-term storage through its stackability, ability to enable oil flushing, and leakage control. The proof of the efficacy of designed artificial lift equipment – in particular, the GeoESP system – lies in how much operators save when they avoid preventable losses due to unsuitable pumps. For example, one German geothermal operator relied on two ESPs to extract water but transitioned to a single GeoESP system with a broader operational range. While the engineer evaluated the equipment for installation, the engineer identified unrepairable power quality issues in the low-voltage variable-speed drive (VSD) output, which would result in six months of downtime while they waited for new equipment. Not only would this downtime affect costs, but it would also potentially leave thousands of Germans without heat. However, the operator installed a GeoESP box test container, which provided a seamless surface solution amid the VSD replacement process. The GeoESP box test container can adapt to different grid voltages throughout Europe and support the geothermal plant while the team replaces the VSD. The GeoController surface package provided the operator with a quick, easy interface for field service and connected to the Intelevate digital platform, which allowed them to analyze real-time data from a mobile phone. This expedited deployment of the box test container averted a potential loss of over €1.5 million in downtime and associated costs. In another scenario, a geothermal operator experienced three ESP failures within 60 days due to scale accumulation, which led to seized systems and broken shafts. The financial impact of such failures could have escalated to €500,000, which included pull expenses, equipment replacement, and operational downtime. The introduction of a GeoESP intake and system monitoring via the Intelevate platform allowed for early detection of scale formation. The operator implemented suggested preventative measures, extended the run time, and enhanced the operation’s overall efficiency, which resulted in cost savings. As more governments and consumers look to geothermal as a cost-effective, reliable power source, the ability to keep costs down and continue operations will boost the industry. Artificial lift solutions tailored to geothermal applications, such as the GeoESP system, help operators unlock geothermal’s full potential, increase safety and efficiency, and reduce costs.

Indonesia’s [Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources](https://www.esdm.go.id/en) (ESDM), Bahlil Lahadalia, has instructed state-owned electricity company PT PLN to expeditiously build a geothermal power plant in the Maluku region, citing the need for the region to not be completely dependent on diesel and coal. According to Bahlil, the 40-MW geothermal power development in Maluku has now been included in the draft of PT PLNs’ 2025-2034 Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL). There are two project sites being targeted – the 20-MW Wapsalit geothermal site in Buru Island, and the 2×10 MW Tulehu geothermal site in the Ambon Island. _“So when there are old generating machines, which are diesel, they are immediately replaced with Renewable Energy (EBT), as a form of the Government’s concern to provide EBT as an international consensus,”_ said Bahlil. Based on 2024 data, the total power generation capacity in the Maluku region has reached 409 MW. About 249 MW of this comes from diesel power plants, followed by gas-based power plants at 157 MW. The contribution of renewables, via solar and hydroelectric power plants, is minimal at only 3 MW. _“With the inclusion of the geothermal power plant (PLTP) project into the RUPTL of PT PLN, the Government wants to significantly boost the use of New and Renewable Energy in the Maluku region and reduce the dominance of fossil energy which has so far dominated the electricity system in the region,”_ added Bahlil. The Wapsalit prospect is currently in the exploration stage and has an expected COD by 2028. Tulehu, on the other hand, is a site that has had a long history of [surface surveys and exploration drilling,](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/exploration-started-on-first-20-mw-phase-of-tulehu-geothermal-project-by-pln-in-maluku-indonesia/) with results from the wells decidedly not meeting the expectations for the project.","Ambon, Bahlil Lahadalia, Buru, Geothermal, Indonesia, Maluku, panas bumi, RUPTL, Tulehu, Wapsalit","Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has mandated PT PLN to accelerate geothermal power development in Maluku, focusing on the Tulehu and Wapsalit sites, as part of its broader effort to diversify energy sources and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. The 40-MW geothermal initiative, including 20 MW at Wapsalit in Buru Island and two 10-MW units at Tulehu in Ambon, has been incorporated into PT PLN’s 2025-2034 Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL). This move aligns with the government’s strategic goals to transition from diesel and coal generation—currently dominant in Maluku’s 409 MW power capacity, where 249 MW is from diesel and 157 MW from gas—toward renewable energy, with renewables representing only 3 MW, mainly solar and hydro. The Wapsalit project is in exploration with a targeted commercial operation date (COD) of 2028, while Tulehu, though extensively surveyed, has not yet met expectations for development. This development signifies Indonesia’s commitment to increasing renewable energy, particularly geothermal, to enhance energy independence and meet international climate commitments.",Geothermal energy; Renewable energy

Indonesia’s [Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources](https://www.esdm.go.id/en) (MEMR) through the [Directorate General of New, Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation](https://ebtke.esdm.go.id/) (EBTKE) has started working on a draft regulation for direct use applications of geothermal resources. The Guidelines for Geothermal Management for Direct Utilization aims to promote geothermal not only as a source for electricity generation, but as an enabler for tourism, agribusiness, and industry. This can help strengthen local economies, and encourage the growth of ecotourism and micro, small, and medium enterprises within the host communities of geothermal projects. However, such an industry still requires strong regulatory support to prosper. _“Direct utilization of geothermal energy is the new face of the clean energy sector that is oriented towards people’s welfare and environmental sustainability,”_ said Eniya Listiana Dewi, Director General of EBTKE. _“More than just a provider of clean energy, geothermal energy opens up opportunities for business and industrial innovation—from green hydrogen production, high-value mineral extraction, to geothermal-based ecotourism development.”_ Eniya further explained that the planned regulation aims to establish a process for direct utilization of geothermal energy. This process will include the issuance of operation feasibility, guidance and supervision, resource conservation, and regulation of geothermal energy prices for direct utilization. The MEMR has so far conducted a public consultation on the draft regulation to gather input from local government, geothermal associations, academics, business entities, and other relevant stakeholders. Direct use applications of geothermal energy in Indonesia currently remain at pilot project scale. A noteworthy example is [the coffee drying facility in Kamojang,](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/pioneering-geothermal-use-for-coffee-production-in-kamojang-indonesia/) which has helped create a more sustainable and efficient business ecosystem for local coffee entrepreneurs. _“This is in line with the Government’s efforts to promote a new paradigm, namely Sustainable Geothermal Development. An approach that emphasizes a balance between economic, social, and environmental benefits, and is in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),”_ further added Eniya.","Agriculture, direct use, EBTKE, Eniya Listiani Dewi, Geothermal, Indonesia, Legislation, MEMR, panas bumi, public consultation, regulation, tourism","Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR), through the Directorate General of New, Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation (EBTKE), is developing a regulation to formalize direct use applications of geothermal energy, aiming to expand beyond electricity production to sectors like tourism, agribusiness, and industry.

The [British Geological Survey](https://www.bgs.ac.uk/) has launched the **[UK Geothermal Platform](https://ukgeothermalplatform.org/)** , an online, interactive and freely available platform that provides information on geothermal potential in the UK, both for shallow and deep technology options. The map explorer is a user-friendly interface for visualising and examining spatial summary and data layers. There are summary layers for: * [shallow, vertical closed loops with ground-source heat pump](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/pension-fund-invests-in-geothermal-heat-pump-network-in-south-wales-uk/) * shallow, open loops with ground-source heat pump * deep, hot, sedimentary aquifers (hydrothermal) * deep, engineered geothermal systems in granites (petrothermal) The summary layers provide information on geothermal energy potential, including indications of thermal output, temperature and cost information based on the study [“UK geothermal energy review and cost estimations” (Arup, 2025).](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-geothermal-energy-review-and-cost-estimations) Such information is valuable for regulators, developers, and researchers looking into developing geothermal systems. For instance, the platform highlights that closed-loop systems can technically be deployed almost anywhere across Great Britain (local planning and regulatory constraints apply). Up to 55% of the population has the potential to extract up to 15000 kWh of thermal energy (the typical annual energy of a gas boiler), via a single, 150 m-deep, closed-loop system. Towns, cities and industrial sites can be assessed for the potential to retrofit geothermal technology and new development zones can be quickly assessed for strategic use of geothermal energy from the start of the development or planning cycle. For example, planned development for the Liverpool–Manchester–Leeds–Sheffield growth corridor can take advantage of multiple geothermal energy technologies. The openly available platform features a user-friendly map explorer and a data access page that also enables you to view more detailed geoscientific information from several organisations, including BGS, the Mining Remediation Authority, environmental agencies, the North Sea Transition Authority and the UK Onshore Geophysical Library. The first release of the UK Geothermal Platform has been funded by the UK Government’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) through the Net Zero Innovation Portfolio. It is delivered and maintained by BGS. _“For the first time, the UK Geothermal Platform makes a large volume of national-scale geothermal data and information available and digitally accessible,”_ commented Dr Alison Monaghan, head of geothermal at BGS. _“It supports a wide range of users in understanding at high level the potential for a range of geothermal energy options, supporting decarbonisation of heating and energy security.”_","British Geological Survey, data, deep geothermal, Geothermal, Great Britain, Map, potential, research, shallow geothermal, UK, UK Geothermal Platform","The British Geological Survey (BGS) launched the UK Geothermal Platform, a freely accessible online tool that maps geothermal potential across the UK, covering shallow to deep geological technologies.

japanese-venture-lets-you-experience-geothermal-onsen-hot-springs-at-home.md,https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/japanese-venture-lets-you-experience-geothermal-onsen-hot-springs-at-home/,Japanese venture lets you experience geothermal “onsen” hot springs at home,Carlo Cariaga,15 Aug 2025,"A Japanese company has crafted technology to concentrate real hot spring water, making it possible to export the genuine Japanese onsen experience. Tokyo-based [Le Furo](https://le-furo.com/en/) is aiming to export the “onsen” hot spring experience outside of Japan to the rest of the world. This is done through their “Craft Onsen” project and a line of products derived from natural hot spring waters and minerals. As CEO Noaki Mita describes it, the products can be likened to espresso in that they are the concentrated components of real hot spring waters. This is unlike many commercially available “onsen powders” that mimic the relaxing color and scent of hot springs but are made of synthetic ingredients. Le Furo’s technology uses the natural minerals of hot spring sources, using a special method to make them soluble in water. The “Craft Onsen” products come in small bottles that can be poured into water to create a hot spring experience that feels like the real thing. The concentration is about 10,000 times that of natural hot spring water. The company is now seeking to expand their operations in the Gulf region, with the Craft Onsen products an essential part of brining the hot spring experience abroad. _“Here in Japan, we have this culture of soaking ourselves in a good, long bath to attain better health — that’s the kind of story that I believe (other countries) will show great interest in,”_ said Mita. Hot springs are a central part of both culture and tourism in Japan, with hot spring destinations having been in operations for multiple generations. For this reason, it is an important consideration for geothermal power plant developers. Places like Okuhida Onsengo showcase the possibility that [geothermal power operations and hot spring businesses can exist alongside each other](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/okuhida-onsengo-japan-showcases-co-existence-of-hot-springs-and-geothermal-power/), and even be in a mutually beneficial relationship.","bath, Craft Onsen, Geothermal, Hot Spring, Japan, Le Furo, onsen, product, Tokyo, tourism","Le Furo, a Tokyo-based company, has developed a technology to concentrate natural hot spring water, enabling the export of authentic Japanese onsen experiences globally. Through its “Craft Onsen” project, the company produces small bottles containing water with mineral concentrations approximately 10,000 times higher than natural hot spring water, making it possible to simulate a genuine hot spring bath when diluted. Unlike synthetic “onsen powders,” Le Furo’s products leverage a proprietary method to make mineral extracts soluble, preserving authenticity and health benefits associated with Japan’s hot spring culture. Currently targeting expansion into the Gulf region, the technology aims to internationalize Japan’s centuries-old wellness and tourism culture. The development underscores the intersection of health, leisure, and cultural export, with implications for the tourism industry and geothermal resource management, as hot springs are integral to both Japanese culture and geothermal energy projects. The innovation exemplifies efforts to combine natural mineral extraction with consumer-ready products, advancing the global reach of Japan’s onsen experience while potentially influencing geothermal power or resource sharing strategies.",Geothermal energy; Climate adaptation; Water management

Pri Utami, M.Sc., Ph.D., IPM, visited PGE’s Geothermal Working Area (WKP) and took samples of geothermal production outputs for laboratory testing._“After analyzing the samples, I found they contained a wealth of materials. Silica was the main one, but there were also many other minerals. Its properties resembled volcanic ash. That’s when I thought, why not turn it into fertilizer?”_ said Pri Utami. She later reached out to her colleague from the Faculty of Pharmacy UGM, Dr.rer.nat. Ronny Martien, a nanotechnology expert, to help transform the white silica powder into a plant-friendly booster. After in-depth research and successful development of the Katrili booster, UGM and PGE began engaging farmers using a participatory and voluntary approach. PGE also provided training and support for farmers. _“Katrili booster is new for most farmers because it works differently from the boosters, fertilizers, or pesticides they are used to. That’s why knowledge and skills transfer is crucial for proper and effective use. Like medicine, if used incorrectly, it won’t work as intended,”_ said Dr. Ngadisih, a soil and water conservation engineer from the Faculty of Agricultural Technology UGM. Beyond Lahendong, the Katrili booster has also been introduced through UGM students’ Community Service Programs (KKN) in several regions in Java, including Wonosobo and Magelang. In addition to silica, the Katrili booster contains chitosan derived from shrimp and crab shell waste—chosen for its abundance in Indonesia. Using this waste not only reduces trash but also offers added benefits to crops through its chitosan content. _“When combined with silica, chitosan coats the plant surface, making it more resistant to pests and better at retaining water. Meanwhile, silica strengthens the structure of plant cell walls,”_ said Pri Utami. Katrili booster is applied by mixing it with water and pouring it directly onto the soil. Dosages vary depending on soil characteristics and crop type. It has been used on various crops, such as Gustavi tomato varieties, batik peanuts, shallots, and rice. Two farmers from Tonsewer Village, Minahasa—Rommie and Danni—have personally experienced the benefits. They began using the booster in 2024 on their tomato crops._“In terms of quality, the crops treated with Katrili booster were clearly superior to those using only chemical fertilizers. The fruits were larger and more resilient. Ripening was more consistent, with a much lower risk of rotting. The plants also withstood extreme weather better, especially when combined with chemical fertilizers,”_ said Danni. Rommie and Danni expressed pride and gratitude for being able to use a booster developed from their homeland. The name Katrili is inspired by a traditional Minahasan dance that symbolizes gratitude and harmony. Rommie said, _“We’re very grateful for this PGE program. We hope it continues so that more farmers can benefit from it. After all, the output from our agricultural work helps many others.”_","Agriculture, chitosan, fertilizer, Gadjah Mada University, Geothermal, Indonesia, Katrili, Pertamina, Pertamina Geothermal Energy, PGE, research, Silica, UGM","A collaboration between PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy Tbk (PGE) and Gadjah Mada University (UGM) has developed the Katrili booster, a fertilizer derived from silica—a byproduct of Indonesia’s geothermal power production—aimed at improving crop quality and sustainability. Originating during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the project involves transforming geothermal silica, rich in minerals similar to volcanic ash, into a plant booster with added chitosan from shrimp and crab shell waste, both abundant in Indonesia. The innovation targets the agricultural sector, particularly local farmers around Lahendong, and has been piloted on crops such as tomatoes, peanuts, shallots, and rice. The Katrili booster is applied by mixing with water and used to enhance plant resilience, with field reports indicating larger, more robust, and better-ripening produce, alongside improved resistance to extreme weather. The technology, still in early deployment stages, leverages nanotechnology and sustainable waste utilization, promoting eco-friendly farming. Its development underscores Indonesia’s potential to valorize geothermal by-products, with implications for sustainable agriculture and rural livelihoods, particularly as it expands through UGM’s community programs in Java.",Climate adaptation

Geothermal drilling will be carried out for the first in the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands beginning the coming fall. The project will be executed by Energía Geotérmica de Canarias (EGC), a company formed by Icelandic company [Reykjavík Geothermal](https://rg.is/), together with the energy company DISA, the largest company in the Canary Islands, and the government of Tenerife through the public companies Technological Institute and Renewable Energies ([Instituto Tecnológico y Energías Renovables](https://www.iter.es/) / ITER) and the Canary Islands Volcanological Institute ([Involcan)](https://involcan.org/involcan-2/). The formal establishment of the EGC took place with a signing ceremony in Santa Cruz, Tenerife held on the 23rd of May 2025. The boreholes will be drilled to depths of between 2500 to 3000 meters, with the objective of confirming the viability of using geothermal energy in the island as clean, stable, and local energy source. Geothermal exploration licenses were awarded to EGC and ITER following a tender in late 2024. Exploration drilling of several sites in western and southern Tenerife was then[ approved by the Government of the Canary Islands ](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/canary-islands-government-approves-geothermal-exploration-drilling-in-tenerife/)earlier this year. Notably, geothermal exploration licenses in La Palma [were also awarded to EGC at the same tender round.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-exploration-contracts-in-canary-islands-awarded-to-nine-entities/) Geothermal exploration takes place in the context of the island’s increasingly urgent need for sustainable and affordable energy. Today, over 80% of Tenerife’s electricity production comes from imported oil. Such an arrangement is both environmentally harmful and extremely expensive, and the Spanish state has to subsidize the energy costs for the island’s inhabitants and, indeed, for all of the Canary Islands. Since it is neither possible to harness hydroelectric power on the island nor is there room to build more large wind and solar power plants, which take up about ten times more land space than comparable geothermal power plants, the use of geothermal energy is gaining increasing importance in the future plans of the island’s authorities. Surface surveys carried out in 2024 showed promising indications of geothermal energy in the southern and western parts of the island. Final administrative authorization from the Canary Islands authorities is now awaited to begin drilling, but the drilling project has already been put out to tender. If the drilling proves successful, it is expected that the development of geothermal power plants could become an important addition to Tenerife’s energy supply, contributing to the energy exchange on the island and thus significantly reducing the use of imported oil. Reykjavík Geothermal is joining the project as both owner and technical leader. The company has [extensive experience](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/kaust-and-taqa-break-ground-on-geothermal-research-well-in-saudi-arabia/) in developing geothermal projects [around the world](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/mt-princeton-to-work-with-icelandic-partners-for-colorado-geothermal-project/) and is now using that expertise to support the first step in utilizing geothermal energy in Tenerife. _“This project is based on the experience, knowledge and belief of us Icelanders in geothermal energy as a sustainable energy source, and could completely change the situation for energy production in Tenerife. The trust that our partners in the project place in us is a great recognition of Icelandic ingenuity and expertise in the field of geothermal energy and an honor for us,”_ says Magnús Ásbjörnsson, CEO of Reykjavik Geothermal.","Canary Islands, Drilling, Energia Geotermica de Canarias, exploration, geotermia, Geothermal, Iceland, INVOLCAN, ITER, Reykjavik Geothermal, Spain, Tenerife","In fall 2025, drilling will commence for Tenerife's first exploration geothermal well, a project spearheaded by Energía Geotérmica de Canarias (EGC), a partnership between Iceland’s Reykjavík Geothermal and Canary Islands’ entities Disa, ITER, and Involcan. The project aims to drill boreholes at depths of 2,500 to 3,000 meters across sites in western and southern Tenerife to evaluate geothermal viability, following licensing awarded in late 2024. This initiative addresses Tenerife’s heavy reliance on imported oil—over 80% of its electricity—by exploring a stable, clean, and local energy source, with surface surveys indicating promising geothermal prospects. The project is part of regional efforts to diversify energy sources, given spatial constraints that hinder expansion of wind and solar power. If successful, geothermal energy could substantially reduce oil imports and contribute to the island’s renewable energy capacity. Reykjavík Geothermal, with extensive international geothermal development experience, leads technical implementation, emphasizing the strategic importance of Icelandic expertise in scaling sustainable energy solutions in the Canary Islands.

Just a few months after [achieving a milestone of having drilled through 100 meters of granite](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/quaise-energy-achieves-100-meters-of-drilling-using-millimeter-wave-technology/), Quaise Energy hosted the first of several planned public demonstrations of their boundary-pushing millimeter wave geothermal drilling technology. Some 56 invited public observers gathered in Marble Falls in Texas to see the drilling process in action. For [Quaise Energy](https://www.quaise.energy/), this represents the latest entry in a series of progressively more challenging demonstrations of their technology. As Justin Lamb, Head of Operations recounted, “ _Last fall we started by drilling four feet into a granite core inside our Houston lab. Then we moved right outside the lab to drill ten feet into another granite core._ ” In May of this year, [the company drilled 40 feet (~12.2 meters) into a granite core](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/quaise-energy-demo-showcases-clean-geothermal-drilling/) on a full-scale oil rig just outside of Houston owned by Nabors. At the recent public demonstration, the observers were able to see the drilling process in action, including the real-time drilling data. They are also able to see and touch the samples of the ablated granite, which were effectively turned into grey ash. Most importantly, they were able to see down the drilled hole through a live video camera – the deepest borehole drilling using millimeter waves so far. The company is hosting six more public demonstrations the Marble Falls quarry over the next three months. There were also other notable observations made during the demo. The drilling rate reached a rate of up to five meters per hour, which the team described as “extremely fast.” Henry Phan, Vice President of Engineering at Quaise, explained that today’s commercial operations average a drilling rate of a tenth of a meter per hour through granite. He also, however, pointed out that the hole diameter at Marble Falls was 4 inches, while the actual goal for production borehole diameter should be 8.5 inches. According to CEO Carlos Araque, it aims to break its own drilling record by drilling ten times as deep, to one kilometer. This could take place within the next few months. The Quaise team continues to do additional tests to optimize specific parts of the process. _“We’ll experiment with various parameters to, for example, control how straight the hole is and see if we can go even faster,”_ said Emilie Williams, Test Group Manager at Quaise.","demonstration, Drilling, Geothermal, granite, Marble Falls, millimeter wave, Quaise Energy, Texas","In a recent development, Quaise Energy demonstrated its millimeter wave geothermal drilling technology in Marble Falls, Texas, marking the deepest borehole achieved with this method to date.

The [Ministry of New and Renewable Energy](https://mnre.gov.in/en/) (MNRE) of India has published the country’s first National Policy on Geothermal Energy, setting an initial framework for the exploration and development of its geothermal resources. The complete text of the National Policy on Geothermal Energy can be accessed [via this link](https://cdnbbsr.s3waas.gov.in/s3716e1b8c6cd17b771da77391355749f3/uploads/2025/09/202509152136711668.pdf). The publication of the policy follows a period of extensive consultation with stakeholders, as well as [the establishment of a Task Force](https://mnre.gov.in/en/notice/constitution-of-task-force-to-harness-geothermal-energy-in-india/) in 2024 to review the draft of the policy. The task force was composed mostly of representatives from various research institutes around India, with a few industry players. The new geothermal policy sets a vision of geothermal energy being one of the major pillars of India’s renewable energy landscape, and thus contributing greatly to the nation’s 2070 Net Zero Goal. In more specific terms, the goals of the policy include: * Improvement of research capabilities on geothermal energy including in the areas of exploration, drilling, reservoir management, power generation, and direct use applications * Collaboration between local Ministries, research institutes, and international geothermal development bodies to incorporate global best practices in exploration, resource assessment, and technology adoption * Deployment of geothermal heating and cooling solutions for buildings, agriculture, and industries * Promotion of advanced geothermal exploration involving deep and multilateral drilling and repurposing of abandoned wells * Establishment of a public-private ecosystem for long-term geothermal development * Capacity building and knowledge sharing The Geological Survey of India has already identified 381 hot springs in the country with surface temperatures ranging from 35°C to 89°C. Most of the geothermal resources in India fall within the medium to low heat enthalpy zone, with resource temperatures of 100°C to 180°C. There are a few higher-temperature sites, particularly within the Himalayan regions. Thus, the GSI has identified 10 geothermal provinces as follows: * Himalayan Geothermal Province; * Naga-Lusai; * Andaman Nicobar Islands; * Son-Narmada Tapi (SONATA); * West Coast; * Cambay Graben; * Aravalli; * Mahanadi; * Godavari; * South India Cratonic. Moreover, the GSI has identified 16 geothermal energy sites, which includes the Puga Valley in Ladakh [where drilling is already ongoing](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-drilling-resumes-for-puga-valley-geothermal-project-ladakh-india/). To facilitate knowledge sharing, the Ministry shall create a geothermal resource data repository which will also include oil and gas industry data on abandoned and existing oil wells, mineral identification, and drilling expertise. The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) Data Repository may be made available for utilization by eligible operators or developers for geothermal prospective analysis. The scope of the policy includes a wide spectrum of geothermal applications, from power production to [ground source heat pump applications](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/leh-airport-set-to-have-indias-largest-geothermal-space-conditioning-system/), direct use, and the extraction of minerals and other byproducts. Currently, 100% foreign direct investment is allowed in India for renewables. There will be preference given to indigenous technologies to reduce dependency on importation and encourage local innovation. The MNRE shall also prioritize the conversion of existing abandoned oil and gas wells for geothermal utilization through collaboration with the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG), the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), and oil companies. Joint ventures are welcome, particularly those between geothermal developers and oil and gas and mineral companies. The government may explore different financing mechanisms such as government-funded exploration, funding from donor organizations, or long-term loans from private and public financial institutions. Fiscal mechanism can also be considered to support geothermal development, such as import tax exemptions, tax holidays on geothermal projects, or property tax exemptions. Project developers may approach state governments for the allocation of potential geothermal zones, for which the appropriate government may grant exploration permits. The Ministry may coordinate with the MoPNG in case of overlap with existing oil fields. State governments may also allocate possible geothermal sites for exploration for 3 years, with possible extension of 2 years (in case of seasonal challenges, such as in the Himalayas region). The sites can then be allocated for further development and exploitation for up to 30 years, with provisional extension. To support the timely implementation of these projects, the Ministry shall facilitate a streamlined single-window support system. States shall designate an agency to facilitate the granting of permits and monitor the implementation of geothermal projects. This agency will act as a single window for all mandatory and statutory clearances required for setting up a geothermal project.","concession, exploration, funding, Geothermal, India, investment, Legislation, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, MNRE, National Policy on Geothermal Energy, Oil and Gas, permitting, Policy, task force","India’s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has published its first National Policy on Geothermal Energy, establishing a comprehensive framework to promote exploration, development, and utilization of geothermal resources.

A new white paper published by [Orcan Energy](https://www.orcan-energy.com/en/) examines the global potential for geothermal energy applications, the prevailing challenges to its wider adoption, the role that modular ORC technology plays in addressing these challenges. **[Click here to download the white paper, “Unlocking geothermal power: how modular ORC technology maximizes clean energy.”](https://www.orcan-energy.com/en/geothermal-white-paper-unlocking-geothermal-power-how-modular-orc-technology-maximizes-clean-energy.html)** The use of Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technology for power plants has significantly expanded the possibilities for geothermal power generation. In contrast to steam turbines, ORCs can exploit smaller heat sources and lower temperature levels. It operates as a closed-loop process, allowing for 100% reinjection of geothermal fluids. Temperature levels for ORC applications typically range from 100 to 180 °C. ORC systems can be used for 100% power generation, or in scenarios where heating and power generation are coupled. Possible fluctuations in heating demand, whether seasonal or in the short-term, highlight the flexibility of modular systems. The white paper presents several case studies on the value of modular ORC systems in addressing challenges in geothermal energy such as adapting to fluctuating heat demand or optimizing heat utilization. Since modules can operate independently, they can adjust to changing heat demand without a large penalty in efficiency. Modular ORC systems can also be useful for different geothermal development models, such as wellhead generation. This is an excellent way to convert standalone or exploration wells into profitable assets. **[RELATED: Frutura converts excess geothermal heat to power with Orcan Energy technology](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/frutura-converts-excess-geothermal-heat-to-power-with-orcan-energy-technology/)**","binary cycle, Geothermal, heating, modular, ORC, Orcan Energy, Organic Rankine Cycle, power plant, Technology, turbine, white paper","Orcan Energy has emphasized the versatility of modular Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technology in enhancing geothermal power generation and managing variable heating demands.

Following the February 2025 announcement of its partnership with [Sage Geosystems](https://www.sagegeosystems.com/) on geopressured geothermal systems, [ABB](https://new.abb.com/power-generation/segments/geothermal-power) has shared further insights on how such collaborations can support the global scale-up of geothermal energy. In commentary by Vijay Rengaraju, Global Industry Business Manager for Power Generation at ABB Energy Industries, the company emphasizes geothermal’s potential role in addressing rapidly growing electricity demand – particularly from data centers, AI, and digital infrastructure. Read the original article: [Sage and ABB partner on developing geopressured geothermal systems](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/sage-and-abb-partner-on-developing-geopressured-geothermal-systems/) **The case for geothermal in the energy transition** While geothermal has long played a niche role, accounting for less than 1% of global power generation, new technologies and rising energy needs are shifting the equation. According to the IEA, geothermal could meet up to 15% of global electricity demand growth by 2050 – equivalent to 800 GW of additional capacity. Geothermal energy offers: * Baseload and grid-stabilizing power * Minimal greenhouse gas emissions * Applications beyond electricity, such as district heating and industrial use ABB believes that scaling geothermal is not just possible, but essential – particularly as energy-hungry sectors seek reliable, low-carbon supply options. **Technology transfer and digitalization** ABB’s work with Sage Geosystems exemplifies the role of strategic partnerships in unlocking complex geothermal systems. The two companies are collaborating to deploy ABB’s automation, electrification, and digital tools at geothermal sites, including those using Sage’s geopressured geothermal and energy storage technologies. Geopressured systems, which extract both thermal energy and pressure-driven flow, offer a new pathway for geothermal development in sedimentary basins. ABB’s broader contribution lies in its ability to transfer knowledge from other sectors—such as oil and gas, power, and industry – into geothermal. This includes: * Subsurface analysis and project design * Industrial automation and instrumentation * AI, digital twins, and cloud-based operations These capabilities are especially important for emerging geothermal technologies like engineered (EGS) and advanced geothermal systems (AGS), which depend on precise modeling, controls, and efficiency optimization. **Meeting future power demand – sustainably** The ABB–Sage partnership is part of a wider push to ensure that data centers and digital infrastructure adopt low-carbon energy solutions. In 2024, Sage signed a deal to supply Meta with up to 150 MW of geothermal baseload power, with first power expected by 2027. As ABB notes, meeting future power needs sustainably will require: * Significant public and private investment * Favorable permitting and policy conditions * Integrated solutions across the energy value chain ABB sees its role not only as a supplier of equipment, but as a technology partner helping the geothermal industry scale more efficiently and cost-effectively. **A collaborative energy future** “The new energy future will not build itself,” says Rengaraju. “But with the right partnerships, the right technology innovation and stable policy frameworks, we can unlock geothermal energy’s full potential.” By combining ABB’s technical expertise with the entrepreneurial innovation of companies like Sage Geosystems, the geothermal sector may be well-positioned to grow from niche to mainstream in the decades ahead.","ABB, AGS, EGS, geopressured, Geothermal, Sage Geosystems, Technology","ABB, in collaboration with Sage Geosystems, is advancing geothermal energy technology through innovative geopressured systems and digitalization, aiming to scale geothermal’s contribution to global power development.

A research team from the [Te Kunenga ki Purehuroa Massey University](https://www.massey.ac.nz/) in New Zealand is collaborating with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and NASA Ames Research Center in California, USA for a project that aims to develop next-generation geothermal monitoring and environmental analytics to monitor geothermal systems from space. The**“Monitoring vegetation-geothermal interactions from space and airborne platforms”** project will receive just over NZD 1 million from a new funding round by the New Zealand Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Technology. Massey University will be leading the project alongside partners Victoria University of Wellington and IIT Bombay, India. It is being led by Associate Professor Gabor Kereszturi from the School of Agriculture and Environment, who is also involved in Volcanic Risk Solutions, the university’s leading volcano research centre. The project focuses on combining thermal (e.g. surface temperature), hyperspectral imaging (the analysis of light reflected from the Earth’s surface), and radar remote sensing (scattering of microwave signals from the Earth’s surface) to assess vegetation around geothermal areas, such as those around Taupo, Rotorua, and Bay of Plenty in the North Island of New Zealand. Plants near geothermal fields are highly sensitive to geothermal activity, particularly heat and toxic metals, which can be observed via equipment orbiting Earth. _“We live in a rapidly changing world where remote sensing techniques offer accessible and innovative solutions for monitoring our environment and making more informed decisions. In this exciting collaboration with NASA-JPL, our project ambitiously aims to roll out a new non-invasive, space-based tool to map geothermal systems across New Zealand and assess their “health” through plant activity. Better integration of different satellite data can unlock the potential to monitor not only geothermal fields, but also volcanic systems and environmental pollution,”_ said Dr Kereszturi. The project will utilise sensors and satellites already orbiting Earth. ECOSTRESS and EMIT sensors are on board of the International Space Station, while Sentinel-1 is one of the flagship satellites of the European Space Agency. All of these provide frequent measurements from space and are available for researchers to access. The project will develop the computing and processing capabilities needed to analyse data for geothermal exploration and monitoring. New Zealand is the first country to apply this method for geothermal monitoring, and if proven, the technique could ultimately be used to monitor geothermal systems around the world, complementing existing geophysical and geochemical methods. This innovative way of assessing geothermal system health opens the door for wider applications, such as evaluating a region’s potential for heat or power generation, detecting contaminants, and monitoring primary agriculture or flooding impacts. A key benefit of this work is its integration of earth observation technologies with Indigenous scientific frameworks, ensuring geothermal monitoring is both technologically advanced and adds further value to the NASA Surface Biology and Geology mission, while also being deeply rooted in Matauranga Maori.

The well had also fulfilled its purpose as a research tool, providing subsurface information at previously unknown depths. Tests will still have to be done to determine the temperature, productivity, and the physicochemical properties of the waters from the well. This information will be the basis for creating a model for the use of thermal waters in the entire Podhale region.

Prior to 2025, millimeter wave drilling had only been demonstrated in the laboratory, with MIT’s early system drilling a hole just a few centimeters deep. While 100 meters is only a fraction of the commercial depth needed for the company’s first power plants, the granite drilled during the field test is the same type of hard rock that blankets the basement layer of the Earth’s crust. The company plans to build on this achievement with an upcoming gyrotron using 10x more power, with a target to complete a pilot power plant in the Western U.S. as early as 2028. _“Our progress this year has exceeded all expectations,”_ said Carlos Araque, CEO and President of Quaise Energy. _“We’re drilling faster and deeper at this point than anyone believed possible, proving that millimeter wave technology is the only tool capable of reaching the superhot rock needed for next-generation geothermal power. We are opening up a path to a new energy frontier.”_ A few months ago, the company held[ the first demonstration of its drilling technology at a full-scale oil rig](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/quaise-energy-demo-showcases-clean-geothermal-drilling/) owned by Nabors, one of the world’s largest oil-and-gas drilling companies. The company started drilling through ten feet of a granite column but have scaled up significantly since then. Quaise’s millimeter wave drilling system, developed after more than a decade of research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), harnesses a powerful gyrotron to ablate rock for the first time without any downhole hardware. Unlike conventional drill bits, which struggle with hard, hot, rocks like granite and basalt, millimeter wave technology allows access to superhot rock—around 752 degrees Fahrenheit (400?)—typically found deep within the Earth’s subsurface.","Carlos Araque, Drilling, Geothermal, gyrotron, milestone, millimeter wave drilling, Quaise Energy, Technology, Texas","Quaise Energy has achieved a significant technological milestone by drilling 100 meters into granite using its millimeter wave drilling system designed for superhot geothermal energy extraction. This marks the first practical demonstration of such technology beyond laboratory tests, which previously only produced centimeter-scale holes at MIT. The system, developed over more than a decade at MIT, employs a high-power gyrotron to ablate rock without conventional drill bits, enabling access to rock at temperatures around 752°F (400°C), representative of deep Earth conditions. The drill was tested at a field site, including a demonstration on a full-scale Nabors oil rig, indicating potential for robust, field-scale applications. The company plans to leverage a more powerful gyrotron—ten times the current power—to accelerate drilling depth and efficiency, with a target to establish a pilot geothermal power plant in the Western U.S. by 2028. This advancement aims to overcome limitations posed by hard rock drilling, expanding the feasibility of geothermal energy as a sustainable power source and opening a new technological frontier in deep-earth energy exploration.",Geothermal energy

This agreement follows up on a memorandum of understanding signed between the two companies in 2023 to build a collaborative relationship in the field of geothermal resource development in Indonesia. A critical foundation of the collaborative project is a study done by JOGMEC on the development of geological and geochemical survey methods for estimating acid fluid distribution areas in geothermal systems. The technical study (in Japanese) is available [via this link](https://geothermal.jogmec.go.jp/report/jogmec/file/240603.pdf). The study aims to develop a generalized method for accurately identifying areas where acidic geothermal fluids exist, allowing for selectively extracting neutral geothermal fluids. This may contribute to the long-term stable operations of geothermal power plants. Knowledge gained from this study can then be applied to geothermal resource surveys in Japan. The scope of work under the project will include geological and geochemical surveys, laboratory analysis and data analysis of rock and fluid samples, and updates on the method used for acid fluid potential prediction. The work is expected to be completed with the 2025 fiscal year, but an extension of the survey period and future surveys are also anticipated. This will be the first project led by JOGMEC under the “Overseas Geothermal Resource Survey” program, where JOGMEC conducts resource surveys and exploration in overseas countries with geologic environments similar to those in Japan. This program started in 2021. It is also part of the Japan-led Asia Zero Emissions Community (AZEC) initiative and the Asia Energy Transition Initiative (AETI). In February 2025, the Government of Japan published the Seventh Strategic Energy Plan which sets a target of 40-50% renewable energy in the power generation mix. A target of 1-2% for geothermal energy was set under this strategy, which is a significant increase from its current 0.3% contribution.

research-in-thurgau-switzerland-provides-valuable-insight-on-geothermal-resource.md,https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/research-in-thurgau-switzerland-provides-valuable-insight-on-geothermal-resource/,"Research in Thurgau, Switzerland provides valuable insight on geothermal resource",Carlo Cariaga,21 Apr 2025,"Research being done on two geothermal boreholes in the Schlattingen region of Thurgau, Switzerland has provided crucial insight on the geothermal resource. A geothermal research project in the Canton of Thurgau in Switzerland has been running for two years, and has provided some important information on the subsurface and the characteristics of the geothermal resource. Findings from the research will be crucial in helping identify other suitable locations for geothermal use, particularly in the area around Schlattingen. An important element in this geothermal research project is the existence of two deep boreholes that are currently providing heat to greenhouses in Schlattingen. [Since 2022](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/swiss-greenhouse-farmer-receives-long-term-concession-for-geothermal-project/), Grob Gemüse AG has been using these two geothermal boreholes. Water from these boreholes has a surface temperature of 64 °C, which then provides heating to greenhouses. The system helps save around half a million liters of heating oil per year. Moreover, the boreholes are drilled into the Muschelkalk at 1200 meters depth, a water-bearing clay and limestone formation that hosts the geothermal resource in the area. This provides an opportunity to gain insight on the resource. Therefore, the Canton of Thurgau submitted a research project to the [Swiss Federal Office of Energy](https://www.bfe.admin.ch/bfe/en/home.html) (SFOE) in 2022. _“The goal is to understand how this geothermal reservoir works and thus increase the chances of success for the future use of geothermal energy,”_ emphasized Philippe Müller, Head of the Energy Research and Cleantech Section at the SFOE. The SFOE and the Canton of Thurgau are sharing the costs. Grob Gemüse AG, for its part, is making the boreholes available for scientific purposes. The research work, led by the [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/index_eng.html), began in early 2023 with the collection of water samples. Comprehensive analyses show that the water from the two boreholes has different origins. Borehole 1 was drilled vertically, while borehole 2 was deviated, so that the catchments are located approximately one kilometer apart. The water from the vertical borehole comes from precipitation that fell during the last Ice Age in the Wutach Valley region of the southern Black Forest. This is where the water-bearing carbonate layer, located in Schlattingen at a depth of approximately 1,200 meters, rises to the surface. The precipitation was able to seep in at this point. Interestingly, a significant proportion of the water from the deviated borehole 2 comes from the crystalline basement, i.e. from rock layers that are even deeper. Dr. Christoph Wanner, scientific director of the project from the University of Bern, explained that this can be proven beyond doubt by, among other things, increased concentrations of helium and lithium. The chemical composition of the water from borehole 2 is similar to the thermal water in Schinznach, Baden, or Riehen. Because it originates from deeper layers, one would expect a higher temperature. However, the difference to the water temperature from borehole 1 is very slight. This suggests that the water must have cooled on its way to the extraction point. This means that the site of water ascent from the crystalline basement is far from the water intake of borehole 2, or the water is rising only slowly. Such water ascents from the basement occur along fault zones, i.e., in cracks and crevices. One such fault zone, the “Randen Fault,” is located near the boreholes. There, the rock layers have been shifted or displaced due to forces in the Earth’s interior. The closer a borehole is to fault-related water ascent zones, the higher the water temperature should be. _“Fault zones are therefore of particular interest for this type of geothermal energy use, so-called hydrothermal geothermal energy,”_ explained Dr. Christoph Wanner. The findings from the research project to date are being incorporated into two models. The first model simulates groundwater flows in the immediate vicinity of the two boreholes. The second model also considers fracture networks near fault zones to better understand the rise of groundwater from the crystalline basement. The models provide a clearer picture of the water-bearing rock layers for the area around Schlattingen, but are also valuable for the canton of Thurgau. The research project will be completed in autumn 2025. The new insights into the subsurface will facilitate decisions to identify other suitable locations for the use of geothermal energy, thus increasing the chances of success for future geothermal projects in the canton.","Christoph Wanner, Geochemistry, Geothermal, Geothermie, Grob Gemüse, Muschelkalk, research, Schlattingen, SFOE, Swiss Federal Office of Energy, Switzerland, Thurgau, University of Bern","A two-year geothermal research project in Thurgau, Switzerland, focused on two deep boreholes in Schlattingen, has yielded significant insights into subsurface geothermal resources. The boreholes, drilled into the Muschelkalk formation at 1200 meters, currently supply heat to local greenhouses, saving approximately 500,000 liters of heating oil annually. Water temperatures of 64°C are consistent, but analyses reveal differing origins: one from recent Ice Age precipitation and the other from deeper crystalline basement interactions, indicated by helium and lithium concentrations. The water from the deeper source appears to cool en route, suggesting complex ascent pathways potentially associated with fault zones like the nearby Randen Fault, which are critical for hydrothermal geothermal energy extraction. Led by the University of Bern, this research aims to enhance understanding of the geothermal reservoir, with models simulating groundwater flow and fracture networks.

The Geological Survey and Mining Management Center (GSMC) under the [Ministry of Economic Affairs](https://www.moea.gov.tw/) of Taiwan has reported progress on the exploration of the top five high-potential areas for geothermal resources in the country. Multiple exploration technologies were deployed mostly to overcome Taiwan’s geological challenges and ensure high-quality data. Following this, the GSMC will be expanding the exploration campaign to 15 other promising sites. According to early studies, the top five areas account for about 80% of the total geothermal potential of Taiwan. These areas are as follows: * Datun Mountain, Taipei * Lanyang River, Yilan * Ruisui, Hualien * Hongye-Wulu, Taitung * Zhiben-Jinlun The MOEA had recently prioritized development of the Lanyang River geothermal area, citing its advantages both in terms of the quality of resources and the ease of accessibility and connectivity. The GSMC has provided some details on the initial results of the geothermal exploration campaign. A 245 °C resource has been detected at the igneous-sedimentary boundary in the Macao area of the Datun Mountain. A 175 °C upwelling channel has been found in the Ruisui area. Temperatures of 150 °C have been measured at the Haiduan and Yanping areas in Taitung. The results of the surveys will be made public on the Geothermal Exploration Information Platform, upholding the value of transparency and helping to spread awareness and support for geothermal. The Government of Taiwan has expressed strong support for geothermal development. For instance, the Executive Yuan Councilor Chen Jinde recently visited the drilling site of the CPC Corporationa’s [Yuanshan No. 1 deep geothermal well](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/drilling-starts-on-4-km-geothermal-well-in-yuanshan-yilan-county-taiwan/) in Yilan County, as well as[ Taipower’s Yilan Renze geothermal power plant](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/taipower-inaugurates-renze-geothermal-power-plant-in-yilan-county-taiwan/). The mountainous terrain of Taiwan pose significant challenges to geothermal exploration. For this reason, the GSMC has expanded their exploration methods from traditional ground-based techniques to airborne gravity and magnetic surveys. Recently, the Center[ introduced Canada’s MobileMT airborne magnetotelluric technology for the first time](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/taiwan-to-deploy-airborne-mt-technology-for-geothermal-exploration-in-yilan-county/), conducting surveys in the middle and upper reaches of the Lanyang River. This technology effectively analyzes the distribution and pathways of heat sources within one kilometer underground. The Center is also collaborating with industry, academia, and research to gradually delineate deep heat reservoir structures through geological surveys, physical exploration, and structural analysis. This “three-dimensional exploration” strategy, combining air and land exploration, improves exploration accuracy and lays the foundation for further geothermal assessment in Taiwan.","Datun Mountains, exploration, Geothermal, GSMC, Hongye, Lanyang River, Ministry of Economic Affairs, MOEA, Ruisui, Taitung, Taiwan, Yilan County, Zhiben","Taiwan's Geological Survey and Mining Management Center (GSMC) has reported significant progress in geothermal resource exploration, focusing on five high-potential sites: Datun Mountain, Lanyang River, Ruisui, Hongye-Wulu, and Zhiben-Jinlun, which constitute roughly 80% of Taiwan’s geothermal potential.

This is a laudable milestone for the company, as it comes less than a year after [their acquisition of the geothermal power facility](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/zanskar-acquires-lightning-dock-geothermal-power-plant-new-mexico/). Zanskar further provides details on their achievements in drilling the new production well, thereby validating the thesis that there are still conventional geothermal resources that are untapped and being overlooked. These included faster drilling using PDC bits, precision steering and oversized intermediate casing to allow the installation of a large-capacity line-shaft pump, deviated drilling, and stochastic resource modeling to plan for a wider range of possible reservoir conditions. The new production well drilled a target depth of ~8000 feet (~2438 m) using PDC drill bits, resulting in 130% faster drilling compared to average drilling time without PDC bits at the Lightning Dock geothermal field. The vertical section was drilled over the first 1800 feet (548 meters), ensuring that there was very little deviation from the vertical to ensure that a line-shaft pump can be installed and operated with minimal issues. The team was successful in doing so, recording a maximum of around 1 degree of deviation over the the whole vertical section. Drilling was then deviated over the course of 5000 feet (1524 m) to hit the reservoir target which was ~2000 feet (~609 m) away. This allowed the team to keep the wellhead close to the plant while still reaching the high-potential target zones, thus minimizing surface infrastructure. Lastly, the team installed a 14-inch line-shaft pump, the largest geothermal line-shaft pump on the market. The decision came about due to a measured productivity index of ~50 gallons per minute per psi (~45.7 L/s/bar) on the production well. Assuming a brine outlet temperature of 50 C, this makes the new production well the more productive than any geothermal well in Nevada, and the most productive pumped geothermal well in the USA.","directional drilling, drill bit, Drilling, Geothermal, Lightning Dock, line shaft pump, modeling, New Mexico, PDC, power plant, production well, reservoir modeling, Zanskar Energy","Zanskar Geothermal & Minerals, Inc.

Domestic and foreign investors are ready to enter the Turkish geothermal sector, but the current pricing mechanism does not encourage an investment environment. This is according to a statement by Ali Kindap, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the [Geothermal Energy Association](https://www.jeotermalenerjidernegi.org.tr/) (JED) of Türkiye, who also appealed for a base price of at least 8 cents per kWh for geothermal power plant that fall outside the scope of the 10-year Renewable Energy Resources Support Mechanism (YEKDEM). Türkiye has been a very strong contributor to geothermal power development in the last decade or so, increasing its installed capacity by more than a hundredfold between 2010 and 2020. By the end of 2024, the country holds a steady position in the top 10 countries for geothermal power with an installed capacity of 1734 MWe. Despite the success of Türkiye and its position of importance in the global geothermal sector, geothermal power plants that have completed the 10-year YEKDEM period are “condemned to float alone in the ocean.” Once they are excluded from the incentive system, these power plants only sell their electricity for a gross price of 6.5 to 7 cents per kWh, essentially continuing production at a loss. _“As a sector, we recommend setting a floor price, not a ceiling, for geothermal power plants that continue to operate as base-load despite being excluded from the YEKDEM system, and setting this limit at no less than 8 cents. This way, investors can conduct cost accounting and generate resources for renewal and capacity-maximizing investments after exiting the incentive system. Given today’s suppressed prices and rising input costs far above official inflation, generating resources for these investments appears impossible,”_ said Kindap. Kindap noted that the disrupted pricing mechanism negatively impacts new investment decisions, noting that geothermal energy investors are undertaking much higher investment costs for resource exploration, discovery, extraction, and processing compared to other renewable energy sources, and that all of these costs are borne by the investor due to the exchange rate. JED Chairman Ali K?ndap also said that a 12.5 cent purchase guarantee is given for 15 years for the energy produced from nuclear power plants, which will become operational in the coming years and whose installed capacity is expected to reach 20,000 MW, due to their base load function. Ali Kindap added that ten years is a very short time in the life cycle of a geothermal power plant, and that there are power plants in the world that have been operating for more than a century. He emphasized that the closure of geothermal power plants, which have zero import dependency, will support the use of energy resources imported with foreign currency. Kindap, who explained that the most vital element for a geothermal investor is the “protection of the geothermal resource,” pointed out that the implementation of a floor price will pave the way for allocating more resources to investments that will sustainably protect geothermal resources The Chairman further stated that 163 MW of geothermal power plants, corresponding to 11 percent of the installed capacity, were removed from YEKDEM in 2024. Another 115 MW of installed capacity will go outside the scope of YEKDEM this year. Between 2016 to 2025, a total of 620 MW of installed capacity of 36% of the total installed capacity will be outside of the coverage of YEKDEM. _“We see that our power plants, which have been excluded from the YEKDEM program, are causing significant losses for investing companies. Domestic and foreign investors are ready to enter the sector. However, the current pricing mechanism does not encourage an investment climate,”_ said Kindap.","Ali K?ndap, Finance, Geothermal, investment, JED, jeotermal, Jeotermal Enerji Dernegi, JeotermalHaberler, power plant, Türkiye, YEKDEM","Turkish geothermal power sector advocates for reforming the current pricing mechanism to attract greater investment, as articulated by Ali Kindap, Chairman of the Turkish Geothermal Energy Association (JED).

Power plants falling outside YEKDEM, amounting to 620 MW (36% of capacity), sell electricity at prices of 6.5 to 7 cents per kWh—below operational costs—posing risks to sustainability. Kindap recommends establishing a minimum floor price of at least 8 cents per kWh for such plants to enable cost recovery and reinvestment, highlighting that current suppressed prices and rising input costs hinder new investment.

The “Formation of fractures and changes in permeability in geothermal reservoirs caused by thermally induced stress changes” (TRIGGER) project was officially kicked off at the [Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz](https://www.uni-mainz.de/) (JGU), which is the institution leading the project. The Volcanic Seismology group of the JGU, as well as the Tectonics and Structural Geology, Geodynamics, and Metamorphic Processes groups are involved in the project. Other partners in the project include the Institute for Geothermal Resource Management at the Institute for Innovation, Transfer and Consulting gGmbH in Bingen, Ruhr University Bochum, and Microstructure and Pores GmbH in Aachen. The TRIGGER project is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWK). Of the approximately EUR 2 million in federal funding, about half will go to the JGU groups. They will contribute in particular to researching the microstructural and microchemical composition of the samples and analyzing their deformation, as well as numerically modeling fluid flow and fracture processes. _“We want to understand the influence of thermally induced cracking on rock properties such as permeability and strength, which in turn could influence the amount of extractable thermal water or seismicity – even though we usually don’t even notice these small earthquakes,”_ explains Prof. Dr. Miriam Christina Reiss of JGU, who is the joint coordinator of the TRIGGER project. Contact between cold water and significantly warmer rock can cause cracks to form and changes in the porosity or permeability of the rock, which can have implications for expected seismicity. These small-scale processes cause local changes in rock properties, which in turn affect large-scale reservoir behavior. The TRIGGER joint project aims to investigate exactly how these small-scale processes behave underground. _“We will examine samples from drill cores taken up to three kilometers deep in the laboratory. We will analyze the thermal, mechanical, structural, and chemical properties,”_ explains Reiss. To recreate and better understand the processes involved, the rock will be deformed, cold water will be introduced into heated rock samples, and sensors will be used to determine whether and how the material fractures. In addition, the laboratory experiments are simulated in computer models to gain a deeper understanding of the processes taking place across a wide range of rock properties and temperatures. _“In the laboratory, we can conduct investigations that aren’t possible in the field,” explains the geophysicist. “With this research, we want to better understand the processes on the one hand, but also explore possibilities for more efficient use on the other.”_ One goal of the joint project is therefore to determine the long-term effects of temperature changes of at least 100 degrees on fracture formation and the interactions between the injected fluid and the rock. The research is also intended to contribute to a more detailed analysis of the risk of induced seismicity – that is, human-caused earthquake activity. _“People are much more open to geothermal energy today than they used to be. We want to contribute to a better understanding of the processes and reduce the risks associated with using geothermal energy,”_ says Reiss. The geothermal power plant near [Insheim](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/german-webinar-gives-insight-into-the-operation-of-the-insheim-geothermal-power-plant-germany/) in the Vorderpfalz region has been in operation for over ten years and generates green electricity.

The Government of the Czech Republic, through the Ministry of Energy, has published an action plan for the development of geothermal energy for heating applications, alongside other strategies for strengthening the country’s energy security and reducing dependence on fossil fuel imports. The Action Plan ([accessible via this link](https://mzp.gov.cz/system/files/2025-07/Akcni_plan_rozvoje_vyuziti_nizkopotencialniho_obnovitelneho_a_odpadniho_tepla.pdf)) focuses specifically on the development of low-potential renewable heat and waste heat. This covers geothermal heat, ambient heat (air and water), and low-temperature waste heat, with heat pumps as an essential complementary technology. To search for promising areas for the use of geothermal energy, the Czech Geological Survey, a state subsidized organization of the Ministry of the Environment, has maps of subsurface temperatures. Based on the current version of the document, “Development of the use of geothermal energy in the Czech Republic,” the potential of geothermal energy in the Czech Republic is sufficient for the gradual replacement of a significant part of primarily small and medium-sized sources (0.1-20 MW) in thermal energy supply systems. Also of interest to the Czech Geothermal Energy Commission is the use of water from flooded mine shafts to harness geothermal energy, as well as the storage of excess heat using borehole thermal energy storage (BTES). Currently, there are only four deep wells used for geothermal heat supply in the Czech Republic – in Decín, Ústí nad Labem, Mušov, and Pasohlávky. The Decín well supplies about 35% of the heat supply in the network to which it is connected, and is the only major operating source of geothermal energy for thermal supply networks in the country. The Mušovv and Pasohlávky wells suppy to nearby aquaparks and are not connected to any thermal energy network. In contrast, there are already around 30,000 small ground water heat pumps installed in the country, connected either to surface collectors or shallow well systems. Thus, the country has substantial expertise in this technology and public awareness of it is already at a high level. The Czech Geotechnical Society has estimated the technical potential of shallow geothermal energy in Czech Republic to be about 300 GWt, while deep geothermal energy is at the higher hundreds of MWt. However, the 350 usable boreholes for temperature measurement is considered insufficient for a more accurate estimation of geothermal potential. **Recommendations for future development** In general, comprehensive support for the development of low-potential renewable heat and waste heat is highly recommended, as high-potential heat (from biomass, biogas, etc.) currently predominates among renewable energy sources. The development of low-potential heat thus represents a largely untapped opportunity. Geothermal energy is considered as an option to transition thermal energy networks from current fossil fuel sources. This is more viable in smaller networks, considering the limitations of low-temperature geothermal resources. Many conflicts are being anticipated in the further growth of geothermal, particularly relating to topics of public interest (protection of water sources and medicinal resources, protection of karst areas, mining works or landslide risks, etc) and possible distrust of residents. These conflicts will need to be resolved through a transparent and evidence-based approach, similar to current efforts of the Ministry of the Environment for wind and photovoltaic projects. Reducing the risk of drilling appears is essential for the development of deep geothermal energy, for which practices abroad (e.g. France) and the use of a certain type of revolving funds or insurance to cover the risk of failure of the first well need to be explored. Furthermore, it is necessary to significantly increase the level of current knowledge of geothermal energy within the Czech Republic, including by increasing the network of exploratory wells.","action plan, borehole thermal energy storage, BTES, Czech Republic, district heating, Geothermal, ground source heat pump, GSHP, shallow geothermal, strategy","The Czech Republic has issued an action plan to develop low-temperature geothermal energy for networked heating, aiming to enhance energy security and reduce fossil fuel reliance.

The country's technical geothermal potential is estimated at approximately 300 GW for shallow sources and hundreds of MW for deep sources, though current data from only 350 boreholes limits precise assessment. The plan emphasizes scaling small and medium geothermal sources (0.1-20 MW), expanding the network of exploratory wells, and employing borehole thermal energy storage. Challenges include public acceptance, environmental impacts, and drilling risks, which could be mitigated by transparent risk management strategies learned from international practices. This development signifies a significant opportunity for Czech energy transition, particularly in smaller networks, with long-term implications emphasizing the need for increased knowledge, strategic investments, and stakeholder engagement.",Geothermal energy; Energy efficiency; Heat pumps; Climate adaptation

The [China Coal Hydrology Bureau](https://eng.yidaiyilu.gov.cn/p/2071.html) and [Fuzhou University](https://en.fzu.edu.cn/) recently held a press conference in Ningde City, Fujian Province to announce the launch of a big data application platform that consolidates and provides visualization of the country’s geothermal resources data. The “One Map of China’s Geothermal Resources” is a first-of-its-kind project for China and provides a useful tool for geothermal development and utilization. The map has currently catalogues 2407 hot springs and 2057 geothermal wells across China. It also has information on 4252 large and medium-sized faults across the country, which can be targets for geothermal drilling. Clicking on each hot spring or well will display parameters such was water temperature and flowrate. The map divides geothermal resources in China into two types – tectonic geothermal belts and large geothermal basins. It also presents a pioneering grading standard for geothermal sites. Through big data algorithms, the platform can be used to predict geothermal resource reserves and well parameters. This scientific and systematic classification provides important technical guidance for the development of geothermal resources in China. To apply learnings from the China Geothermal Map, the China Coal Hydrology Bureau located and drilled a high-temperature geothermal well at a depth of 1740 meters in Tanyang Village in January 2025. The temperature at the bottom of the well was measured at 82°C and the surface water temperature was 52°C. Hot water from the well was supplied to the village’s capsule homestay facility. The agency has also built a geothermal heat demonstration project in the high-altitude area of Baoshan Village in Gansu Province. In the future, the China Coal Hydrology Bureau aims to continue promoting the integration of geothermal projects with initiatives on rural revitalizatoin and ecological protection. **[RELATED: Sinopec touts geothermal achievements in China at stakeholder event](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/sinopec-touts-geothermal-achievements-in-china-at-stakeholder-event/)**","Baoshan, big data, China, China Coal Hydrology Bureau, China Geothermal Map, data, Fujian, Fuzhou University, Geothermal, Map, Ningde, Tanyang, visualization","China has launched its first comprehensive big data and visualization platform for geothermal resources, titled “One Map of China’s Geothermal Resources,” developed by the China Coal Hydrology Bureau and Fuzhou University.

A recently published article written by Marit Brommer and Helen Robinson of the [International Geothermal Association](https://worldgeothermal.org/) (IGA) highlights the huge opportunity of the mining and geothermal energy industries to empower each other, both in terms of exploiting economic opportunities and developing complementary skills. **Click here to read the full article,[“Striking heat and metal: why mining and geothermal should forge a new alliance.”](https://www.seequent.com/striking-heat-and-metal-why-mining-and-geothermal-should-forge-a-new-alliance/)** The mining and geothermal energy industries have already had history of working together. The first geothermal power plant in Africa was built in the Katanga Province of the Democratic Republic Congo. Although modest in size at only 250 kW capacity, the binary plant provided power to the local tin mining operations using water from a nearby 91 °C hot spring. A more recent example is [the Lihir geothermal power plant in Papua New Guinea](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/gold-mining-in-png-when-geothermal-heat-is-a-challenge/), which has been supplying power to gold mining operations since 2003. Today, this project is considered a model in the use of geothermal energy for more sustainable mining activities. Another form of synergy between mining and geothermal can be found in the UK and the Netherlands, where water from flooded mine galleries are used to provide low-carbon heating to houses, schools, and businesses. A mine water heating scheme [has been operational in Gateshead since 2023](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/gateshead-uk-mine-water-geothermal-heating-scheme-hailed-a-success/), and [another in Wales](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/mine-water-heat-scheme-in-wales-uk-starts-operations/) just started operating a few months ago. Mining and geothermal share many core exploration methods such as geophysical data acquisition, surface mapping, geochemical sampling and 3D modeling. One such example is the geological modeling software developed by [Seequent](https://www.seequent.com/), which was initially created for mining. However, the subsurface modeling portfolio of Seequent has [played a critical role in shaping the geothermal industry globally](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/interview-how-seequent-remains-relevant-amidst-an-evolving-geothermal-industry/) for more than a decade now. The circularity of this relationship is immediately apparent in the high demand of the geothermal industry for specialty metals, whether in drilling, well construction, or surface infrastructure. Thus, there are several avenues in which the convergence of these two industries can be capitalized on. The article calls for the following concrete measures: * Integrated licensing for overlapping geothermal and mining tenures * Open data platforms for subsurface exploration and resource characterization * Co-investment strategies for joint geothermal-mining projects * Incentives for mine water geothermal planning in closure and reclamation stages","Democratic Republic of Congo, district heating, Geothermal, Helen Robinson, IGA, International Geothermal Association, Lihir, Marit Brommer, mine water, Mining, Netherlands, Papua New Guinea, Seequent, UK","Recent developments highlight the strategic convergence of mining and geothermal energy industries, emphasizing mutual benefits through technological and infrastructural integration. Historically interconnected, these sectors share exploration methods such as geophysical data acquisition, surface mapping, and 3D modeling, exemplified by the Africa’s 250 kW geothermal plant in the DRC and the Lihir geothermal project in Papua New Guinea, which has supplied sustainable power to gold mining since 2003. In the UK and the Netherlands, mine water from flooded galleries now provides low-carbon heating for residential and commercial buildings, showcasing practical applications of synergies. The use of subsurface modeling software developed by Seequent has been crucial in both sectors, demonstrating technological overlap and industry maturity. As geothermal energy increasingly demands specialty metals used in drilling and infrastructure, the industries’ mutual dependence is deepening. The International Geothermal Association’s recent publication advocates for integrated licensing, open data platforms, co-investment strategies, and incentives during mine reclamation to foster joint development, positioning both sectors for enhanced sustainable growth and resource efficiency globally.

mitigating-geothermal-drilling-risks-with-ai-driven-advances.md,https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/mitigating-geothermal-drilling-risks-with-ai-driven-advances/,Mitigating geothermal drilling risks with AI-driven advances,Carlo Cariaga,4 Aug 2025,"Leveraging AI-backed solutions from oil and gas drilling, NOV helps geothermal operators drill their wells with reduced risk and enhanced efficiency. _Drilling remains one of the primary cost drivers of any geothermal development. This means that it also presents plenty of opportunities for improvement. In this article written by**Gary Hickin** of **[NOV](https://www.nov.com/)** , we take a close look at the successful deployment of the company’s AI-backed[ Drilling Beliefs and Analytics](https://www.nov.com/products/drilling-beliefs-and-analytics) platform for geothermal drilling operations in Europe. The case study examines the use of advanced data processing technologies for real-time feedback and proactive remediation of potential issues._ Geothermal well construction is gaining momentum in more locations, driven by the need for reliable energy sources that address global sustainability and carbon reduction targets. However, tapping into deeper, hotter geothermal energy resources presents several drilling challenges, including wellbore instability, differential sticking, and fluid losses. These challenges are compounded in remote locations where real-time oversight is limited, and traditional monitoring techniques cannot effectively detect risks early. A geothermal operator in Europe approached [NOV](https://www.nov.com/) to develop a proactive monitoring and mitigation solution that would enhance drilling efficiency, safety, and reliability. NOV proposed a solution backed by [artificial intelligence](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-ppas-gain-ground-with-data-center-demand/) (AI), which integrates data analytics and machine learning to continuously analyze high-frequency data, extract patterns, and report actionable insights more quickly and accurately than conventional analysis methods. NOV originally developed its AI-driven drilling solution for oil and gas operations. The solution utilizes real-time drilling data to build a probability index or belief system that assesses the likelihood of situations such as ballooning, pack-off, cuttings buildup, or bit whirl. The drilling team receives alerts to take the appropriate corrective actions that mitigate the issue and allow drilling to continue. Encouraged by the results of the AI system’s predictive capability on its legacy drilling data, the operator agreed to deploy NOV’s AI drilling solution in a two-well geothermal pilot study. Specifically, the solution would focus on detecting abnormal pressure losses that could indicate formation damage, fluid losses, or wellbore instability. NOV followed a structured methodology to adapt the AI solution for the geothermal pilot. The system was connected to existing drilling infrastructure on two geothermal drilling rigs, each equipped with a suite of sensors and electronic drilling recorder (EDR) systems. These systems provided high-resolution, real-time data on parameters including weight on bit, torque, rotary speed, standpipe pressure, and block position. Each rig also included an edge computing device integrated with the rig’s EDR data streams, which acquired and processed the real-time operational and contextual data (including information on the bottomhole assembly, casing, and fluids) that served as inputs for the AI models. The AI system employed a hybrid architecture specifically designed to address geothermal dysfunctions. The architecture included Bayesian networks that encode expert drilling knowledge to facilitate probabilistic reasoning. In addition, decision-tree algorithms draw knowledge from historical geothermal and analogous oil and gas wells to perform pattern recognition. These components enable the AI system to combine learned data behaviors with encoded expert knowledge, accurately predicting drilling conditions and detecting anomalies. The system used the output to create belief scores ranging from 0 to 1, which represent the probability of various dysfunctions. The operator visualizes these scores on custom dashboards and sets alerts that serve as a digital “tap on the shoulder.” The operator receives an earlier warning of a potential problem, allowing them to take the proper corrective actions to avoid non-productive time (NPT) or damage to drilling equipment or the wellbore. During deployment in the two-well pilot, the AI-driven solution collected and processed more than 70,000 real-time data points per hour, per rig. The solution consistently demonstrated its ability to detect and classify early signs of abnormal pressure losses, such as mud loss and differential sticking. The operator observed several additional operational benefits from the AI-driven solution, including: * Reduced alert latency, with the edge computing architecture alerting the operator of pressure abnormalities up to 45 minutes earlier than conventional monitoring systems. * Minimized NPT through earlier and more accurate corrective actions, preventing downhole incidents from escalating and requiring longer and more expensive remediation. * Earlier event prediction, thanks to the AI’s ability to quickly detect trends, identify root causes, and propose the right corrective actions. The successful adaptation of an oil and gas drilling data solution to geothermal drilling showcases AI’s versatility and potential in the energy sector. AI’s ability to learn and adapt to new operational contexts proved effective in monitoring and mitigating drilling challenges in the European geothermal pilot. By detecting abnormal pressure losses and offering actionable insights, the solution enhanced operational efficiency and safety while supporting the operator’s environmental efforts. Ultimately, this pilot program showcased AI’s potential to revolutionize geothermal energy exploration, providing a blueprint for future applications in the sector.

The bill proposes the establishment of a legal framework for the prospecting, exploration, and exploitation of geothermal resources in the country that also allows for participation of private entities. According to the proposal, the [General Directorate of Hydroelectric and Mining Energy](https://www.dgehm.gob.sv/) (DGEHM) will act as the administrative authority responsible for enforcing compliance with the regulations, as well as processing permits, authorizations, and concessions. The agency will also identify areas with geothermal potential and put these out to tender to investors, who will then benefit from tax benefits for the first 10 years, as well as exemption from tariffs, income tax, and other duties. Under the proposal, a project is developed through three stages: * Prospecting – this requires only a permit, which lasts 12 months and can be extended * Exploration – this allows for the technical evaluation of the reservoir and the obligation to reinject geothermal fluids; exploration permits are granted for areas up to 50 square kilometers, and last 36 months which can then be extended once for 24 months * Exploitation – this allows for geothermal resource exploitation through concessions of up to 30 years, subject to approval by the Legislature The proposed regulation also includes provision on environmental and water resource protection, the creation of a Geothermal Registry, the requirement to submit financial and technical reports, and corresponding sanctions and fines for violations. If the law is approved, it will go into power six months after publication in the Official Gazette. El Salvador has played a key role as [the leader of the geothermal energy sector in Central America](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/el-salvador-reaffirms-regional-geothermal-leadership-at-11th-geolac/). The country operates two geothermal plants, both under state-owned LaGeo, with an installed capacity of 204 MWe. Just a few months ago, the Ahuachapan geothermal power station celebrated a major milestone with the[ 50th anniversary of its start of commercial operations](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/lageo-celebrates-50-years-of-ahuachapan-geothermal-power-station-in-el-salvador/).","concession, DGEHM, El Salvador, exploration, General Directorate of Hydroelectric and Mining Energy, geotermia, Geothermal, Geothermal Energy Bill, Legislation, Nayib Bukele, permitting, proposal, regulation, tender","El Salvador is advancing geothermal energy development through a proposed bill to establish a legal framework for prospecting, exploration, and exploitation of geothermal resources with private sector participation.

The [Supervisory Authority for Regulated Activities](https://sztfh.hu/) (SZTFH) of Hungary has declared that the entire geothermal thermal spring environment of Budapest will be a closed concession area, citing the resources as particularly sensitive and vulnerable. As a consequence of this, the geothermal exploration rights near Budapest that had previously been granted to [PannErgy](https://pannergy.com/) have been revoked. According to Regulation No. 7/2025 of the SZTFH, the research, extraction, and utilization of thermal water within the specified area will require unified, central management. Unfortunately, the target zone for planned geothermal development by PannErgy based on exploration rights also falls within this restricted area. A statement by PannErgy states that the company is now considering all the legal, professional, and business operations available to help decide on the fate of the potential geothermal project in Budapest. For their part, the SZTFH also sent a position paper to publication [VG](https://www.vg.hu/) explaining how they came to the decision. According to the position paper, the experts under SZTFH have been investigating the risk and opportunities relating to thermal water utilization in Budapest. A series of geophysical, geological, and hydrogeological studies were done to create a model that supports the work of water management authorities. However, the SZTFH emphasizes that the regulation will enter into force on 20 June 2025 but will not affect previously issues exploration permits, particularly those that were acquired before the regulation came into force. Rather, the exploration permit of PannErgy was withdrawn because the company had not carried out the exploration tasks specified in the permit at the time frame specified. The SZTFH goes on to state the agency continues to promote geothermal energy as a safe and sustainable renewable energy. The authority will continue to support the licensing processes, supervise legal operations, and work to ensure that geothermal energy becomes an important part of the energy supply of Hungary.","Budapest, concession, exploration, geotermikus, Geothermal, Hot Spring, Hungary, PannErgy, permit, SZTFH, water management","Hungary’s Supervisory Authority for Regulated Activities (SZTFH) has established Budapest's geothermal waters as a protected, closed concession area to promote sustainable management, effective from June 20, 2025.

GeoAlaska has classified Mt. Augustine as a “blind” geothermal system. This means that it lacks surface manifestations but is structurally comparable to Cerro Pabellón (Chile) and the Kakkonda (Japan) fields. Updated modeling now estimates the site’s capacity at 204 MWe (P50), with a potential range between 167 and 243 MWe. Development costs are projected at approximately $2.5 million per installed MWe. The well is planned as a NE/SW deviated well to intersect both the shallow (200–350°C) and deeper (350–400°C) targets. According to Guy Oliver of Ignis Energy, “ _By targeting both zones in one wellbore, we minimize costs while maximizing information on thermal gradient, fracture presence, and fluid connectivity.”_ Despite the project’s remote location roughly 100 km southwest of Homer, Oliver notes that logistical risks are manageable. _“Augustine Island offers good access via shallow sandy beaches and sheltered landing sites. Once equipment is in place, we can drill year-round,”_ he said. The well site sits below the snow line and is advantageous from a risk potential of storm surge and/or tsunami events. Beyond its technical promise, Mt. Augustine could become a strategic asset for Alaska’s Railbelt grid, which supplies over 75% of the state’s population and currently depends on Cook Inlet natural gas. With supply expected to fall short by 2027, geothermal offers a unique opportunity to provide round-the-clock, carbon-free baseload power. _“Geothermal is the only renewable capable in the Region of delivering 24/7 baseload low carbon power,”_ said Oliver._“A project of this scale would be a key part of Alaska’s future energy mix. The highest and best use of the limited gas supply in the Cook Inlet region is to heat Alaska’s homes and commercial buildings.”_ The project was recently featured in the Talk of Alaska podcast by Alaska Public Media, featuring Gwen Holdmann (ACEP), John Eichelberger (Alaska DNR), and Anthony Pennino (GeoAlaska).

A study conducted by Icelandic partners presents the opportunities to expand geothermal heating in the city of Beius in Bihor County, Romania. The geothermal district heating system of Beius currently supplies 70% of its population, but the local governments seeks to expand this to 100% coverage. The project “Technical Development of the District Heating System” in Beius was conducted by the National Energy Authority of Iceland together with UAT Beius, with funding from Innovation Norway from the European Economic Area (EEA) and Norwegian grants. The results of the study was presented recently at meeting attended by the Mayor of Beius, representatives from the [Romanian Geoexchange Society](https://geoexchange.ro/), several geothermal specialists from Bihor County, as well as members of the local authority. Baldur Petursson from the Icelandic Environment and Energy Agency stated that there was potential for further development of geothermal in Beius to benefit from EEA subsidies. Further, Horia Ban of the Romanian Geoexchange Society presented complementary projects on heat recovery from spent geothermal brine, which can still be extracted and upgraded using heat pumps. This can be used for industrial and agricultural applications, such as greenhouses, wood drying, and fish farming. Another important conclusion of the study is that heat losses in the district heating system can be minimized by using specialized material, such as pre-insulated PE-Xa pipes. A geothermal well drilled to a depth of 2600 meters in 1996 tapped a high-flow reservoir with a temperature of 85 °C. This jumpstarted the use of geothermal for heating in Beius, supplying affordable and sustainable heat to apartment blocks, hospitals, nurseries, kindergartens, and other public institutions. A second well was drilled in 2004, and a third in 2010. Today, Beius is the city with the cheapest heating costs in Romania. While Western Romania already has extensive history in geothermal utilization, the capital of Bucharest has also undertaken studies to evaluate the feasibility of geothermal heating. In 2024,[ an agreement was signed between the local utility company ELCEN and the US Department of Energy](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-study-in-bucharest-romania-to-be-supported-by-us-doe/) to jointly study the potential for geothermal heating in Bucharest. Another similar agreement was signed later in 2024 for a similar study with Sage Geosystems, in partnership with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).","Beius, Bihor County, district heating, expansion, feasibility study, Geothermal, heat loss, heat pump, Iceland, Norway, research, Romania","A recent study by Icelandic partners, including the Icelandic Environment and Energy Agency and the National Energy Authority, outlined opportunities for expanding geothermal district heating in Beius, Romania, aiming for 100% coverage from the current 70%.

In the case of well interventions, one of the top priorities is ensuring that the integrity of the well is not compromised. This is showcased in this case study by French drilling company**[Enedril](https://www.enedril.com/)** where a downhole pump had to be fished out of a well._ Geothermal energy is emerging as one of the most promising solutions for the energy transition. Yet, harnessing underground heat requires complex infrastructure and delicate maintenance operations. Among these, **fishing** —the retrieval of equipment stuck at the bottom of a well—is one of the most challenging maneuvers. A recent case illustrates the technical hurdles involved, as well as the sometimes unexpected solutions that ensure production continuity. During the retrieval of a submersible pump installed in a geothermal well, almost the entire piece of equipment became stuck at great depth. Initial hypotheses suggested that the pump was either lodged at the junction between the 13-3/8’’ and 9-5/8’’ casings, or blocked inside the 9-5/8’’ casing due to the presence of power and treatment cables. The challenge was twofold: precisely locating the pump and defining a fishing strategy that would not compromise the integrity of the well, which was essential for ongoing exploitation of the resource. Several scenarios were considered: the pump might have fallen to the bottom and come to rest in open hole, become stuck on a casing cut at 254 m, or been jammed by residual cables. These uncertainties made planning complex and required the anticipation of multiple technical strategies. Options ranged from recovering the pump body with a large-diameter overshot, to retrieving the central shaft with smaller tools, or fishing for the cables with a harpoon. As a last resort, milling of the casing or pump was considered—a heavy and risky solution. The first attempts proved unsuccessful. Neither the 8-3/8’’ overshots used externally nor the smaller tools targeting the pump shaft managed to free the equipment. The main difficulty lay in the depth of the intervention—over 2,000 meters—and the limited capacity of the rig, which prevented efficient maneuvering at that depth. Faced with these setbacks, the teams began considering milling, viewed as the last resort. In the end, the solution came from a much simpler approach. By using an overshot of only 3-7/8’’ fitted with a small 1-3/8’’ grapple, operators managed to hook onto the pump’s shaft, held in place by two circlips. Against all odds, the pump was successfully extracted the very next day. Beyond the technical anecdote, this operation highlights[ the strategic importance of maintenance in geothermal energy](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/hd-completes-milestone-turbine-maintenance-work-for-iceland-geothermal-power-plant/). Each successful intervention helps extend the life of installations, secure energy availability, and guarantee project profitability. In a context where renewable heat is expected to play a central role in decarbonization, mastering such operations is crucial. This case study also serves as a reminder that successful fishing relies as much on the ingenuity of the teams as on the tools at their disposal. Geothermal energy, often perceived as a silent and invisible resource, conceals behind each megawatt produced a wealth of specialized expertise. It is precisely this combination of technical robustness and operational pragmatism that makes geothermal energy an energy source for the future. Founded in 2013, Enedril specializes in directional drilling, fishing operations, and well interventions, including Workover and Plug & Abandonment (P&A). The company also designs and manufactures a wide range of downhole tools, offering tailored solutions for geothermal energy, oil and gas, mineral exploration, and underground storage projects.

Backed by ISO 9001 certification, Enedril maintains rigorous quality systems, standardized procedures, and a culture of continuous improvement.","downhole pump, Drilling, Enedril, fishing, Geothermal, Geothermie, maintenance, Technology, well intervention","Enedril, a French company specializing in directional drilling, well interventions, and fishing operations, demonstrated a successful case of removing a stuck submersible pump from a geothermal well, highlighting critical operational challenges in geothermal energy maintenance. The operation, conducted over a depth of approximately 2,000 meters, involved complex decision-making to retrieve equipment lodged at junctions between casings or trapped by residual cables, with initial attempts using overshots and smaller tools failing. Ultimately, a novel approach employing a small-diameter overshot fitted with a grapple allowed the team to hook the pump’s shaft and successfully extract it, emphasizing ingenuity and precision in tool selection. This case underscores the importance of well integrity preservation during interventions, vital for ensuring continuous geothermal energy production and securing project viability. Geothermal energy’s emerging role in decarbonization underscores the need for advanced, adaptable intervention techniques.

After[ drilling and extensive well testing](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/democell-project-validates-geothermal-potential-in-lower-saxony-germany/), the DemoCELL project in Ahsnbeck is now considered the most advanced and successful deep geothermal project in the State of Lower Saxony in Germany. Geothermal resources with a temperature of 113 °C at a depth of 2500 meters have been verified, and will soon be harnessed for district heating. _“Nowhere in Lower Saxony are we as advanced as we are here,”_ Carsten Mühlenmeier, President of the State Office for Mining, Energy and Geology (LBEG) said during a visit to the drilling rig near Ahnsbeck. The DemoCELL project is a collaboration between the [Georg-August University of Göttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/1.html) and [Baker Hughes](https://www.bakerhughes.com/). The study site is part of a geothermal exploration license area [awarded to Baker Hughes back in 2023](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/baker-hughes-granted-geothermal-exploration-permit-for-ahnsbeck-germany/) by the LBEG. As Dr. Oliver Höhne, project manager at Baker Hughes, explains, only 75 °C is expected at depths of 2500 meters under average conditions. Through the various tests and studies done by the experts at Baker Hughes on the study site, they had already expected that they were standing on a hot spot. Dr. Matthias Franz from the University of Göttingen further explains that the geothermal resources are hosted in a 40-meter-thick layer of the Rhät sandstone. The reservoir formation at this site was of exceptionally high quality, and it was unlikely that such conditions can be found just a few kilometers to the south. The same formation corresponds to that found in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, where the deep geothermal projects in Waren an der Müritz and Neustadt-Glewe have been successfully supplying geothermal energy 1984 and 1994, respectively. Holger Schwenke, Managing Director of [Stromversorgung Osthannover](https://www.svo.de/) Holding GmbH (SVO) assures that households in Celle will be supplied with heat from geothermal in the future. However, the surrounding towns of Ahnsbeck and Lachendorf will have to be connected to the source first. Waste heat from the paper mill can then be used to boost the heat supply to bridge the 12-kilometer distance to Celle. There is substantial heat demand in Celle, particularly in the medieval town center. Schwenke further explained that the company is now just waiting for funding approval from the Federal Ministry of Economics _“We have now issued 42 permits for geothermal exploration, 32 of them in Lower Saxony,”_ explains Mühlenmeier. Aside from Lower Saxony, the agency has also granted seven permits in Schleswig-Holsten, two in Bremen, and one in Hamburg. All these territories are also within the authority of the LBEG. The permits granted by LBEG grants companies the right to search for geothermal resources. However, the discovery risk remains a hurdle at this stage, especially if deep geothermal resources are being targeted. However, this is no longer the case in Ahnsbeck following the drilling and well testing phases. “There’s now almost unlimited energy available here,” explains Mühlenmeier. _“Ahnsbeck can become a showcase project.”_ In addition to its role as a mining authority, the LBEG is also the Lower Saxony Geothermal Service (NGD), which provides technically neutral and economically independent advice on near-surface and deep geothermal energy and creates and maintains geoscientific fundamentals",,"The DemoCELL project in Ahnsbeck, Lower Saxony, Germany, marks the most advanced deep geothermal development in the region following successful drilling and well testing. The project, a collaboration between Georg-August University of Göttingen and Baker Hughes, verified a geothermal resource at 2500 meters depth with a temperature of 113 °C in Rhät sandstone, surpassing initial expectations of 75 °C. The high-quality reservoir is significant for the potential of district heating, with plans to supply heat to the nearby town of Celle, utilizing waste heat from a paper mill to bridge a 12-kilometer infrastructure gap. The project benefits from the geothermal exploration license awarded to Baker Hughes in 2023 by the Lower Saxony Mining, Energy, and Geology Office (LBEG), which also issues exploration permits across the region. The exploration phase indicates a near-uniquely hot spot in Ahnsbeck, positioning it as a showcase for deep geothermal energy in Germany.

Plans for a geothermal heating project serving the Nécotin school complex in Orléans, France have officially fallen through as announced by city officials. The project, first announced in March 2024, turned out more expensive than initially expected and ran into land use issues. The initial plan is for a pilot project to utilize geothermal to replace natural gas heating in the Nécotin school complex. The work was supposed to take place during the summer school holidays of 2025, with commissioning to follow by the fall. If the project proved successful, geothermal heating can then be deployed to other public institutions in the city. The reasons for no longer pursuing the project were announced during a city council meeting. Based on the feasibility study, the project was going to cost EUR 2 million. However, after bids had been submitted, it was discovered that the cost would exceed EUR 3 million. Moreover, 25 boreholes had to be drilled over a substantial area, which would introduce issues relating to land use. Sandrine Menivard, Deputy Mayor in charge of rehabilitation work, however explained the the project would have delivered on its CO2 emissions promise. According to the offers, the system would reduce CO2 emissions by up to 90% and deliver energy savings of 75% to 80%. _“We can only regret this rather significant difference between the preliminary study and the actual proposal. I therefore understand the desire not to extend it to other schools, but we could perhaps have pushed the exercise to the end, at least in this school,”_ said councilor Baptiste Chapuis, who had supported the project since its initial announcement.","bidding, borehole, district heating, Drilling, exit, France, Geothermal, Geothermie, heating, investment, Nécotin, Orléans, pilot project","The city of Orléans, France, has canceled a planned pilot geothermal heating project for the Nécotin school complex due to rising costs and land use challenges.

The drilling and testing of a geothermal research well in the city of Krefeld in North Rhine-Westphalia Germany have now been almost completed, and early results are promising. The postulated limestone host of the geothermal resource was successfully drilled into, and was found to be much thicker than initially thought. After four weeks of drilling, the Kohlenkalk was reached at a depth of 380 meters. A pleasant surprise came when the well intersected the base of the Kohlenkalk at 944 meters, which is much deeper than the postulated depth of 725 meters. This means that the host rock is thicker than expected, thus also increasing the potential for geothermal utilization at the site. Subsequent hydraulic tests also confirmed that more water can be pumped from the borehole than initially expected. Nearly 667 meters of core samples were collected from the wellbore, and the analysis of these samples is still ongoing. As project leader Ingo Schäfer explains: _“They tell us a lot about the carbon limestone, its reservoir properties, and the geological processes that formed it.

To explore geothermal potential of this area TLS Geothermics has acquired a new lease in western Saxony for geothermal exploration (OstVogtland Warme project). TLS Geothermics has developed, inside its systemic exploration workflow, a dedicated geophysical process in order to quantify B-CFZ geothermal potential. This workflow is based on the joint inversion of gravity, passive seismic and magnetotelluric data (3 passive methods). Each method provides complementary information on density, resistivity and seismic velocity models in the crust. Combined, these methods can help to quantify pressure, temperature, lithology (mineralogy and porosity) as well as fluid composition, with the ultimate goal of efficiently quantifying the geothermal potential and target the first exploration wells. Agathe Hantraye has an Engineering Degree and a Master’s degree in Geophysics from the School and Observatory of Earth Sciences (EOST) in Strasbourg, France. Following a stint as an intern student in TLS Geothermics, she is now working as a Geophysical Engineer and is responsible for seismic survey design, preparation data acquisition missions, and data analysis. Nicolas Dall’asta has a Master’s Degree n Geology and Earth Dynamic from the University of Strasbourg and a PhD in Earth Science from the University of Pau and Pays de l’Adours. He is currently an Exploration Geologist for TLS Geothermics and is responsible for geothermal projects in Martinique and Germany.

Konris Maynard of the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis. The insights from that conversation have been published below._ The Caribbean twin-island Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis is embarking on an ambitious journey that could transform it into the Western Hemisphere’s first fully sustainable independent nation. During a recent conversation with Hon. Konris Maynard, Minister of Public Infrastructure, Energy, Utilities, and ICT, I gained valuable insights into how this small nation is tackling large energy challenges through innovative approaches to geothermal development. For Small Island Developing States (SIDS), energy isn’t just about keeping the lights on—it’s the foundation upon which all economic development rests. Minister Konris Maynard emphasised how the current high energy costs are significantly impacting the Federation’s economy, with the government currently subsidising residential electricity costs through the Fuel Variation Charge to shield consumers from the full burden of escalating global fuel prices. This subsidy, while necessary in the short term, represents a substantial fiscal challenge apparent across many SIDS that diverts resources from other critical development areas. The economic implications extend beyond household budgets, as high energy costs also deter energy-intensive industries from establishing operations in the Federation, limiting economic diversification and employment opportunities. The government’s push toward renewable energy, particularly geothermal, represents a strategic shift away from this previous model toward one that promises both economic and environmental benefits. Saint Kitts & Nevis possesses distinct advantages for geothermal development that make it particularly promising. As Minister Maynard explained, _“The heat amount is much closer to the surface than in other areas of the world, so you don’t have to drill as deep to get to it.”_ This geological advantage significantly reduces exploration and development costs. The journey toward harnessing this resource has been complex, involving multiple administrations and financial institutions. The current breakthrough came through [a financing structure from the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) called a “contingently recoverable grant facility,”](https://www.caribank.org/sites/default/files/publication-resources/Partnering%20Renewable%20Energy.pdf) providing $17 million USD—$16 million for drilling and $1 million for technical support. The innovative risk-sharing mechanism converts to a concessionary loan if drilling succeeds or a grant if it fails, thereby reducing the financial risk for the Federation. However, this funding alone wasn’t sufficient to attract top-tier drilling companies to the project. Minister Maynard noted that the $16 million would only fund approximately three wells, making it challenging to entice global drilling experts to mobilise for such a limited scope. The solution came through [additional financing of $20 million from the Saudi Fund for Development](https://www.loopnews.com/content/st-kitts-and-nevis-secures-us20m-loan-for-geothermal-development/), bringing the total available funding to $36 million—[enough to drill five wells](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/nevis-geothermal-project-going-into-bidding-process-for-drilling/) (three production wells and two reinjection wells). Perhaps equally important was resolving the long-standing political challenge between the federal government and the Nevis Island Administration (NIA). The current administration took a decisive step by passing a resolution in the National Assembly declaring geothermal resources on Nevis a federal asset that will receive federal support. This political alignment between the two administrations sends a clear signal to international partners about the Federation’s united commitment to the SKNICE – St. Kitts and Nevis Islands Climate Enhancement Project, for the benefit of all citizens of St. Kitts and Nevis. One of the most transformative aspects of the geothermal development plan is the potential to create a unified electrical grid connecting St. Kitts and Nevis. Minister Maynard highlighted how this interconnection would allow industries on either island to benefit from renewable energy resources developed on either island, creating a more resilient and flexible energy ecosystem. _“With geothermal, it justifies interconnecting the two islands. St. Kitts and Nevis then becomes one electrical grid, so any industry developed on St. Kitts or Nevis will be able to share any renewable energy resource on either island,”_ explained Minister Maynard. This approach maximises the utility of renewable resources across the Federation and creates a more attractive environment for industries that require reliable, affordable electricity. The unified grid represents a physical manifestation of the political collaboration now taking place between the federal government and the Nevis Island Administration. Perhaps the most ambitious aspect of St. Kitts and Nevis’ energy vision is the potential to move beyond self-sufficiency to become a net energy exporter to neighboring islands. With initial estimates suggesting the geothermal wells could produce between 5-10 megawatts each—potentially yielding 15-30 megawatts—the Federation could generate more electricity than it currently needs. Minister Maynard envisions two potential avenues for this surplus energy. First, direct electricity export through undersea cables to nearby islands. Having personally visited Mallorca and witnessed its 250km undersea interconnection with Spain, the Minister noted that Antigua is just 60km away and St. Martin approximately 50km—making such connections technically feasible. Second, using surplus energy for what energy experts call “Power-to-X” applications—converting electricity into other valuable products like hydrogen or ammonia. This approach could create new industries and export opportunities beyond simply selling electricity. _“With this vast resource of geothermal, it opens up industries but also justifies interconnecting with other islands,_ ” said Minister Maynard. _“Right here in the Caribbean, we can be a beacon of energy that interconnects with these islands.”_ As St. Kitts and Nevis prepares to host the [**Global Sustainable Islands Summit 2025**](https://islandinnovation.co/events/global-sustainable-islands-summit/) and the [**Geothermal Energy Forum**](https://islandinnovation.co/events/global-sustainable-islands-summit/geothermal-energy-forum/) , Minister Maynard extended an invitation to renewable energy stakeholders worldwide to participate in these events. _“This is an opportunity to be part of history,”_ he emphasised. _“We are on a path to make St. Kitts and Nevis the first fully sustainable island state in the Western hemisphere and perhaps even the world.”_ The Minister’s closing observation captures the essence of what makes this small nation’s approach to energy so compelling: ** **_“St. Kitts and Nevis is small enough to make big changes.”_ The Federation is demonstrating how opposing political parties can align behind a shared vision of sustainability, and how a nation with limited resources can leverage strategic partnerships to undertake transformative energy projects. **For those interested in renewable energy development, particularly in island contexts, the upcoming**[**Global Sustainable Islands Summit in May 2025**](https://islandinnovation.co/events/global-sustainable-islands-summit/)**presents a unique opportunity to witness this ambitious vision taking shape and to explore partnership opportunities in what promises to be a showcase for sustainable island development.** For more insights from the interview with Hon.

baker-hughes-enabling-enhanced-geothermal-systems-with-transformative-technologies.md,https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/baker-hughes-enabling-enhanced-geothermal-systems-with-transformative-technologies/,Baker Hughes – Enabling Enhanced Geothermal Systems with transformative technologies,Carlo Cariaga,18 Aug 2025,"With growing interest in Enhanced Geothermal Systems, Baker Hughes is deploying both new and established technologies to help accelerate its deployment. Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) are emerging as one of the most promising frontiers in geothermal energy, potentially enhancing its productivity and efficiently, and making it possible to implement geothermal projects in more parts of the world. To learn more about EGS and the technologies that are enabling its adoption, we spoke with **Ajit Menon** , Vice President for Geothermal at **[Baker Hughes](https://www.bakerhughes.com/)** , a global energy technology company with decades of geothermal experience and is actively involved in current EGS efforts. In this interview, Ajit provides fantastic insights into how the company is enabling the growth of EGS through transformative technologies, drawing from its rich history in both geothermal and oil and gas. Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) seek to overcome the geographical limitations of conventional geothermal systems by engineering reservoirs in hot, impermeable rock, using stimulation techniques to create artificial flow paths. Baker Hughes considers EGS as a huge opportunity to scale geothermal and accelerate its growth, targeting sites that would not have been considered for conventional systems. _“In the U.S., for example, EGS allows us to move beyond traditional hotspots on the West Coast into much broader territories across the western U.S., where there is high heat but no existing reservoirs,”_ Menon noted. _“This opens up significant new ground for geothermal deployment.”_ With the location flexibility of EGS, it becomes an attractive prospect for any industry or use case that needs constant clean energy. This has drawn interest from organization such as the US Department of Defense, as well as data centers. It is also worth considering for islands or remote areas that need to import energy, or have limited land available for solar and wind. An important technical benefit of EGS is its reduced development risk. EGS allows developers to start with a known geological setting and build the reservoir artificially, leveraging temperature gradients and rock type without entirely relying on the existence of complex hydrothermal reservoirs. This makes it a more attractive option for new investors and developers seeking more predictable outcomes. Baker Hughes has taken a technology-agnostic stance on geothermal development, building a broad portfolio that addresses the entire geothermal value chain: from subsurface imaging and drilling technologies to artificial lift and surface power generation equipment. According to Menon, EGS represents a major step change in the geothermal sector’s ability to scale, both geographically and in terms of project size. EGS as a concept has been around for decades. Even in the 1970s, there have been early efforts for research in EGS, then-known as “hot dry rock.” However, the commercial viability of EGS is now being redefined by technologies and methodologies derived from the shale gas revolution. The oil and gas sector’s advancements in high-temperature drilling, horizontal wells, and large-scale stimulation are now being repurposed for geothermal applications. Baker Hughes draws extensively from its experience in unconventional oil and gas, applying learnings to key EGS pilot programs, including the U.S. Department of Energy’s [FORGE project in Utah](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/utah-forge-extended-circulation-test-confirms-egs-connectivity-and-heat-extraction/) and other commercial developments. The company’s contributions have included specialized drill bits and bottom-hole assemblies that broke performance records in hard rock conditions. _“Much of what we’re doing today in EGS builds on what we learned in shale,”_ said Menon _. “FORGE has been critical in validating those approaches for geothermal. We’ve moved from theoretical models to field-proven applications.”_ An important part of Baker Hughes’ EGS approach is the characterization of the subsurface fracture network. Poor understanding of fluid pathways was a key contributor to past EGS projects that did not meet their goals. To address this, the company applies advanced modeling tools to develop heat-flow-enabled reservoir simulations, which integrate both static geological inputs and dynamic stimulation models. These are used to optimize well locations and trajectories, plan stimulation programs, and predict long-term reservoir performance. Beyond the drilling and reservoir stimulation, the challenge of scaling EGS is also about engineering efficient, repeatable, and integrated systems. Baker Hughes approaches this with a focus on systems integration and performance optimization across every stage of geothermal development. The company’s Subsurface-to-Surface (S2S) workflow is a digitally integrated solution that connects subsurface models, microseismic monitoring, well designs, artificial lift configurations, surface power generation systems, and digital workflows. _“It’s not just the focus on individual technologies. As you scale, you will have to work with complex systems. We are talking about so many different variables that you can modify to make the system more efficient and optimized,”_ said Menon. _“Our S2S workflow actually connects all these processes and then digitizes them. This allows us to explore a lot of different scenarios.”_ On the drilling side, EGS presents one of the toughest environments: horizontal wells in hot, hard formations such as granite. These conditions produce extreme vibration and thermal stress, which can reduce tool life and performance. Baker Hughes applies a systems approach to this challenge, designing tools rated for high temperatures, implementing technologies to reduce vibration, and using fluids to reduce the temperatures at which the tools are exposed to. Putting all these technologies together is a key in scaling EGS, especially as EGS projects go to hotter environments and drill longer laterals. With EGS presenting a huge opportunity to scale, technology companies like Baker Hughes are also incentivized to develop new technologies for such environments. For example, the deep drilling tools developed for the IDDP-2 project in Iceland, though not widely commercialized at the time, now provide a technological foundation for EGS projects demanding even hotter and deeper wells. Beyond EGS, Baker Hughes continues to support a wide range of geothermal projects, from [conventional hydrothermal systems](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/democell-project-validates-geothermal-potential-in-lower-saxony-germany/) to [experimental single-well concepts](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/baker-hughes-reports-progress-on-wells2watts-geothermal-research-consortium/). The company’s experience in directional drilling, high-temperature completion tools, and surface facilities engineering enables it to support hybrid developments and novel geothermal configurations. Menon highlighted that many of the technologies developed for conventional geothermal have crossover applications to EGS. Baker Hughes has the largest installed base of geothermal Electric Submersible Pumps (ESPs) globally, and have worked extensively improve this technology. The work that the company has done on designing high-temperature, high-flow ESPs and improving the reliability of these systems, by mitigating scale formation for instance, can benefit both EGS and conventional geothermal systems. _“It all goes back to the whole S2S paradigm,”_ Menon said. _“Operators will want to take into account all the parameters of running an EGS project. This includes understanding the characteristics of the geothermal fluid and how it behaves after it has exited the wellbore. Good design of surface facilities is just as important in ensuring an efficient project.”_ In parallel with technological advancements, the geothermal sector is witnessing a significant shift in public and institutional awareness. A decade ago, geothermal was rarely mentioned in energy policy discussions. Today, EGS features prominently in conversations around energy security, baseload renewables, and decarbonization. “ _The fact that people outside the industry now ask about geothermal and EGS is a big change,”_ said Menon._“We’re seeing coverage in the media, government programs, and investor interest all rise sharply.”_ Menon also noted that the broader energy demand landscape is favorable to geothermal. With rising global electricity demand, all power generation sources are under pressure to expand. Unlike nuclear or other renewables, geothermal is very scalable in the near-term using existing oilfield infrastructure and a trained workforce. Baker Hughes is playing a pivotal role in enabling the next generation of geothermal energy through technologies that help scale EGS projects, as well other geothermal plays.

grid-stress-and-utility-shifts-is-geothermal-ready.md,https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/grid-stress-and-utility-shifts-is-geothermal-ready/,Grid stress and utility shifts: is geothermal ready?,Alexander Richter,20 Jun 2025,"Data center electricity demand is reshaping U.S. power markets. Could geothermal provide clean, firm capacity as utilities face rising stress? The structure of the U.S. power sector is going through a fundamental shift. The rapid growth of AI-driven data centers is leading to a surge in electricity demand—demand that is now starting to outpace grid capacity and is putting pressure on traditional utility business models. It is therefore not surprising to see an increasing number of articles and studies addressing this development. According to the latest [_Horizons_ report by Wood Mackenzie](https://www.woodmac.com/horizons/us-data-centre-power-demand-challenges-electricity-market-model/?__FormGuid=737fa606-1f5f-4489-aec9-6b139fc288f7&__FormLanguage=en&__FormSubmissionId=ffb45f83-3213-4ceb-9e3f-4be6544cf75b), more than 130 GW of proposed data center capacity has now entered the development pipeline. This is more than double the capacity reported just one year ago. What is particularly noteworthy—based on Wood Mackenzie’s analysis—is that this growth is not limited to established tech hubs. It is now also expanding to other parts of the country, including Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Ohio. These are regions where local power systems are often less prepared for this scale of new load. For utilities, keeping pace with this trend is becoming increasingly difficult. They are caught between multiple pressures: ensuring grid reliability, avoiding stranded investments, and dealing with regulatory uncertainty. In regulated markets, some utilities are starting to respond with new large-load tariffs and faster generation planning. But in deregulated areas, where market prices are expected to drive investment, forward price signals are currently not sufficient to trigger new capacity. As a result, the gap between what data centers are planning and what the grid can provide continues to widen—raising concerns around system stability, financial risk, and who will ultimately pay for the necessary infrastructure. In this context, geothermal energy – particularly next-generation solutions like enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) – is receiving new attention as a possible clean and firm power source. A [March 2025 study by the Rhodium Group](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/could-geothermal-meet-rising-data-center-electricity-demand/), which we covered earlier this year, suggests that geothermal could supply a significant share of future electricity demand from data centers. In a scenario where these facilities continue to cluster around traditional infrastructure hubs, geothermal could meet up to 64% of the new load by the early 2030s. If data centers were to locate closer to strong geothermal resources, this figure could rise to 100%, with significantly lower electricity costs compared to grid-connected supply. Geothermal is especially well-suited for this type of application due to several key characteristics: high capacity factors, constant availability, and the possibility to operate behind the meter. This last point is important – especially as delays in grid interconnection and regional congestion are becoming more frequent. Being able to bypass the grid and deliver electricity directly to data center operations presents a clear strategic advantage. At the same time, geothermal plants have a relatively small land footprint, which is attractive for developers seeking reliable and space-efficient solutions. However, there are still barriers to overcome. Permitting processes – particularly on federal land – remain long and complex. How recent changes by the new U.S. administration will indeed on a broader scale help speed up those processes will have to be seen, yet [recent news are proimising](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/ormat-geothermal-projects-to-be-covered-by-us-emergency-permitting-procedures/) in that direction. In many states, [legal clarity around subsurface heat](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/who-owns-geothermal-heat-a-version-from-a-geologists-perspective/) rights is still lacking. And while investment into geothermal drilling and development is increasing, the supply chain and workforce are only beginning to scale. Furthermore, the independent power producer (IPP) model that most geothermal developers follow may face regulatory and contractual challenges, especially when entering procurement systems designed with other technologies in mind. A further question that often comes up in discussions is whether data center companies will actually invest in power generation directly – or if they will remain purely electricity buyers. In the past, most preferred to rely on utility partnerships and renewable energy credits. But this could be changing. Companies such as [Google are engaging beyond power purchase agreements](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/fervo-and-google-geothermal-power-facility-starts-grid-supply/), but how and if [they are actively investing in clean energy supply](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/google-cloud-partners-with-slb-project-innerspace-for-geothermal-resource-identification/), including geothermal will have to be seen. In select cases, there are early signals that hyperscale developers may enter into direct contracts with IPPs, especially if the projects can deliver firm, hourly-matched clean power that aligns with corporate climate targets. This could open new opportunities for geothermal developers – particularly those able to offer behind-the-meter or co-located solutions. It would, however, also require new forms of collaboration and risk-sharing between project developers, investors, and corporate buyers – something that will not happen automatically, but needs to be designed and built. As Wood Mackenzie points out, this is not only a matter of energy supply – it is a question of how the electricity market is structured. If utilities and competitive power markets are not able to deliver at the speed and scale that is now required, other models will have to emerge. Geothermal may not have been developed with AI infrastructure in mind, but its characteristics make it a compelling option for addressing the combined challenges of reliability, emissions, and load concentration. Whether the sector can take on this role will depend on more than technology – it will require faster permitting, clearer regulation, willingness to partner with new types of buyers, and a much more ambitious approach to scaling deployment in the years ahead. **Sources:**[Wood Mackenzie Horizons White Paper – June 2025](https://www.woodmac.com), [Rhodium Group Report – March 2025](https://rhg.com/research/geothermal-data-centers/) Tags SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE * Follow Think GeoEnergy * [About Us](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/about/) * [Terms & Condition](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/about/terms-conditions/) * [Privacy Policy](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/about/privacy-policy/) * [Advertisement](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/advertisement/) * [Our Advertisers](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/our-advertisers/) * [Support](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/support-us/) * [ENGLISH](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/) * [EN ESPAÑOL](http://www.piensageotermia.com/) * [IN TURKISH](http://www.jeotermalhaberler.com/) All rights reserved. © ThinkGeoEnergy ehf. 2025 We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

A feature article published by Iceland’s [GRO International Centre for Capacity Development, Sustainability, and Societal Change](https://www.grocentre.is/gro) highlights Kunzes Dolma, an alumna of the GRO Geothermal Training Programme (GRO GTP) and the first women to be trained in the geothermal profession in India. Since her return, Kunzes has been promoting the use of geothermal in the Ladakh region, but has advocated for gender equality and the participation of women in decision-making in Ladakh. Kunzes attended the GRÓ Geothermal Training Programme in Iceland in 2017, where she specialized in geothermal utilization. _“At that time not much was done in India to utilize the low temp fields that we have and so I took the opportunity to learn,”_ Kunzes explains. _“I saw the impact that geothermal development had made to Iceland which otherwise used to be a poor country a few decades back. And so, I was motivated to do the same back in my country, the fact that most of the geothermal sites in India are in remote areas, made me think more of promoting this energy for not only infrastructure development, but also for the community. Geothermal is my passion now,”_ Kunzes further reflect. Upon her return to Ladakh, she started a greenhouse project using geothermal heat to grow vegetables in winter time. She also started raising funds to provide geothermal space heating for the Puga residential school. Her early work led to the decision of the India Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) to undertake the development of geothermal in Puga, where [a 1-MW development is currently being eyed.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-drilling-resumes-for-puga-valley-geothermal-project-ladakh-india/) Her time in Iceland also inspired Kunzes to advocate for gender equality and the welfare of women, particularly those who are experiencing domestic violence. _“Many women are forced to live in the house where they are assaulted, due to the absence of a women shelter where they would otherwise live safely and fight for justice,”_ she stated. With this experience, she has played a part in the plans to put up the first women’s shelter in Ladakh, as well as a cradle centre, where children can be left safely when their mothers are unable to care for them. Kunzes is also acting as India’s Ambassador for [Women in Geothermal](https://womeningeothermal.org/) (WING), a global organization aimed at promoting the professional development and advancement of women in the geothermal industry. Her efforts to promote gender equality in decision-making at state level have bore fruit.

The [Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy](https://www.bundeswirtschaftsministerium.de/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html) (BMWE) of Germany has published a new draft bill for the Geothermal Energy Acceleration Act (GeoBG) which will be the country’s first-ever geothermal energy law. The Ministry opened a public comment period on the draft, drawing responses from various associated organizations. With the deadline for comments now over, the organizations have released official statements reflecting their stance on the draft law. Compared to the draft of the previous coalition government, [then called the GeoWG](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/experts-in-germany-express-support-for-geothermal-acceleration-act/), the new GeoBG draft includes provisions to facilitate seismic measurements along paved roads, allowing for more measurements per year. The draft also proposes faster approval procedures through fixed deadlines and digital processes, and a legal clarification of the overriding public interest of geothermal. The [German Geothermal Association](https://www.geothermie.de/) (BVG) expressed their support for the draft law, praising it in many respects while also providing inputs for how it can be improved. Specifically, the current draft does not provide for any simplifications in the review of project sites with regard to their suitability for a nuclear repository. Until now, even for small facilities such as those in single-family homes, drilling at depths of 100 meters or more requires an assessment of whether a repository is feasible at that location. _“That doesn’t make sense, because repositories are only technically feasible at depths of 300 or even 400 meters. Therefore, we continue to consider shifting this limit important and hope for improvements in this area in the further legislative process,”_ said Gregor Dilger, Managing Director of BVG. _“With this draft, the federal government recognizes the urgency of expanding renewable technologies for the heat transition. In particular, the proposed classification of infrastructure projects as projects of overriding public interest is a key step toward closing existing legal loopholes,”_ said Dr. Simone Peter, the President of the [German Renewable Energy Association](https://www.bee-ev.de/) (BEE). _“This will significantly shorten lengthy approval procedures and accelerate expansion. This sends a positive message not only to industry, project developers, and municipalities, but also to all consumers.”_ The [German Association of the Energy and Water Industries](https://www.bdew.de/) (BDEW) considers the draft law as a sound basis for the expansion of geothermal as climate-neutral heat supply, citing many of its positive aspects. However, the association calls for widening the scope of application and definitions in the draft to include all relevant types of systems, such as smaller heating and storage systems. The BVG further calls for measures to ensure equal treatment with other forms of energy, such as wind energy, and thus the full implementation of EU directives. Among other things, the preferential building regulations in open areas and the provision of public spaces through the Geothermal Energy Acceleration Act are to be addressed. Likewise, the German Geothermal Association is calling for the designation of acceleration areas for all forms of geothermal energy to ensure the full implementation of the Renewable Energy Directive – similar to wind energy. _“Geothermal energy can make a key contribution to climate protection, long-term stable energy prices, and security of supply. Geothermal energy is available everywhere and at any time. No fuels need to be imported for its use, nor do their supply routes need to be secured. And technologically, we in Germany have all the expertise in-house,”_ concluded Dilger.","BDEW, BEE, Bundestag, Bundesverband Geothermie, BVG, draft, GeoBG, Geothermal, Geothermal Energy Acceleration Act, Geothermie, GeoWG, Germany, Gregor Dilger, Legislation, proposal, public comment","Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy has published the draft Geothermal Energy Acceleration Act (GeoBG), marking the country's first comprehensive geothermal energy legislation aimed at accelerating exploration and approval processes.

The aim of the extensive investigations was to obtain the most precise possible geological map of Magglingen’s subsurface and to gain insights into potential warm deep water sources for geothermal heat generation. The analysis of the collected data suggests several potential deep water reservoirs. From this initial image of the subsurface, the course and location of geological layers and faults can be derived. Due to the complex subsurface beneath Magglingen, an area of uncertainty remains in the interpretation of this data and the resulting model. Further measures and investigations are intended to further reduce the uncertainty and the associated risk of failure in any drilling operation. Exploratory drilling is necessary for many geothermal projects because the exact location of the deep water is uncertain and key parameters such as water temperature, water volume, and flow rate are unknown. These factors are crucial for the economic use of the deep water. The planned exploratory drilling at a depth of approximately 1,500 to 2,300 meters will reduce existing uncertainties and project risks. At the same time, it will provide important insights into the subsurface. The implementation of the exploratory drilling and the drilling for deep water utilization requires funding approval from the Federal Parliament. The Federal Office for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FOBL) will compile the costs of the drilling by the end of 2025 and will likely present them to Parliament as part of the 2026 Real Estate Dispatch. In addition to funding approval from Parliament, drilling permits from the cantonal authorities are also required for the drilling for deep water utilization.

The geothermal project in Purchase seeks to replace the existing natural gas heating and cooling system. Natural gas use is responsible for more than half of the direct combustion of fossil fuels at the site, so it was an opportunity for the company to reduce their emissions. Drilling of 160 boreholes each to 600 feet (182 meters) depth will be done that the lawn in front of the headquarters. Energy from the boreholes will be fed to a closed-loop [ground source heat pump](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/us-doe-publishes-series-of-geothermal-heat-pump-case-studies/). This system will siphon heat from the building, store it in the ground, and pump it back to the building during winter. The company is also installing solar panel arrays on their Tech Hub in O’Fallon, Missouri, and on their headquarters in Dubai and the UK. Mastercard states that the investments made in geothermal and solar technology is just the first phase of a broader commitment to build truly resilient energy systems, demonstrating that profitable businesses can also be good neighbors for the the local and wider global communities.","Geothermal, geothermal heat pump, ground source heat pump, GSHP, headquarters, heating and cooling, Mastercard, New York, office building, purchase, shallow geothermal, solar power, Sustainability","Mastercard is deploying a geothermal heating and cooling system at its headquarters in Purchase, New York, as part of a broader sustainability strategy incorporating renewable energy technologies such as solar power.

geothermal-ppas-gain-ground-with-data-center-demand.md,https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-ppas-gain-ground-with-data-center-demand/,Geothermal PPAs gain ground with data center demand,Alexander Richter,15 Apr 2025,"Geothermal PPAs are rising fast as data centers and corporations seek 24/7 clean power. Discover how this shift drives new geothermal energy growth globally. Is the geothermal energy sector entering a new phase of growth? Driven by a surge in electricity demand and the need for reliable, round-the-clock renewable power there are indications that indeed this is the case. While solar and wind have long led the way in green energy procurement, a rising wave of geothermal power purchase agreements (PPAs) is positioning geothermal as a critical player in the global energy transition. **Why geothermal PPAs are growing** For years, corporate and utility PPAs favored solar and wind due to falling costs and rapid deployment. But now, geothermal’s unique value—24/7 stable, clean electricity—is capturing attention. It’s particularly well-suited for organizations that can’t afford power interruptions, such as data centers. In the United States alone, more than a dozen new geothermal PPAs have been signed since 2019. Tech leaders like Google and Meta are leading this trend, signing large-scale deals to ensure constant clean energy for their operations. **Data Centers: a major driver of demand** Data centers are expanding rapidly, fueled by AI, cloud computing, and digital infrastructure. By 2030, they could consume 9% of all U.S. electricity. Unlike intermittent renewables, geothermal can meet these high, always-on energy needs, as also recently pointed to in a research report by Rhodium Group by * Just in, [Fervo Energy signing 31 MW PPA with Shell Energy](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250415938962/en/Fervo-Energy-Announces-31-MW-Power-Purchase-Agreement-With-Shell-Energy) (with now a fully contracted 500 MW of Fervo’s Cape Station in Utah). * [Google signed a 10-MW PPA with Baseload Capital](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/google-baseload-capital-ink-geothermal-ppa-in-taiwan/) in Taiwan (including an equity deal). * [Google signed a 115 MW PPA](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/google-to-increase-geothermal-power-supply-to-data-centers-via-nevada-utility/) with Fervo Energy in Nevada, delivering geothermal power via NV Energy by 2026. * [Meta is partnering with Sage Geosystems](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/meta-signs-150-mw-geothermal-power-purchase-agreement-with-sage-geosystems/) for up to 150 MW of geothermal power by 2027. * Analysts suggest [geothermal could serve 64% of new data center power demand](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/could-geothermal-meet-rising-data-center-electricity-demand/) through 2030 in the U.S. **Global Growth in Geothermal PPAs** Beyond the U.S., geothermal PPAs are gaining momentum globally, supported by local policy and rising corporate commitments to net-zero targets. **U.S.** Just in today, [Fervor signed a 31 MW PPA with Shell Energy](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/fervo-signs-31-mw-geothermal-ppa-with-shell-energy/) for its Cape Station geothermal project upping the totally contracted amount to 500 MW of this groundbreaking large-EGS project. **Taiwan** As we reported today, [Google signed a 10 MW PPA with Baseload Capital](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/google-baseload-capital-ink-geothermal-ppa-in-taiwan/) and made an equity investment to help unlock up to 60 GW of geothermal potential. **Japan** **Philippines** **Policy support remains key** Policy incentives continue to shape the geothermal PPA landscape, creating more attractive conditions for investment and development. **Country Policy Tool Impact** * U.S. Renewable Portfolio Standards Boosts geothermal PPAs, e.g., [California’s 60% goal](https://www.energy.ca.gov/about/core-responsibility-fact-sheets/developing-renewable-energy) * Turkey [YEKDEM Feed-in Tariff](https://futureenergygo.com/turkeys-feed-in-tariff-for-renewable-energy-sources-support-and-yekdem-2022-outlook/) drove capacity from 100 MW (2010) to over 1 GW * [Philippines Geothermal Service Contracts](https://doe.gov.ph/renewable-energy/geothermal-service-contract-gsc-applications-31-december-2023) Supports consistent PPA growth for local utilities **Why geothermal is gaining value** Geothermal energy is standing out in today’s energy mix because it uniquely meets the need for baseload, emissions-free power—something solar and wind can’t deliver alone. Key advantages of geothermal in PPAs sound like the usual rant on why geothermal is a great choice with things like corporate sustainability alignment, reducing CO? at scale and policy compatibility with RPS, FITs, and green tariffs, practical implications for data centers are likely more driving, such as 24/7 power for high-demand users like data centers, and grid stability, complementing variable renewables. **What’s next for geothermal energy?** The convergence of data center growth, corporate clean energy goals, and supportive policy frameworks is fueling a shift. **Geothermal PPAs are no longer niche – they are strategic.** With major untapped potential in markets like Taiwan, Japan, East Africa, and Latin America, and with innovations like enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) on the horizon, geothermal energy is poised to scale. **Conclusion: the geothermal opportunity** Geothermal PPAs are emerging as a key tool to deliver the stable, clean power the world needs.

The [National Environmental Licensing Authority](https://www.anla.gov.co/) (Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales / ANLA) of Colombia has released a concept note stating that thermal gradient wells, as part of geothermal energy activities, will not considered subject to environmental licensing. The note defines thermal gradient wells as thin shallow boreholes, with depths ranging from 50 to several hundred meters, intended to measure at depth and assess the potential of the geothermal resource in the area of interest during exploration. Since these are drilled for the purpose of geological and geophysical observation, they are not subject to environmental licensing and do not require a prior approval from the ANLA. This procedure can be carried out as a preliminary step or in parallel with a project’s environmental assessment process, without prejudice to any permits for the use and exploitation of natural resources that may be processed before regional environmental authorities, if applicable. However, the letter emphasizes that other geothermal exploration activities that directly affect the reservoir and may generate significant environmental impacts are still subject to environmental licensing.

The use of geothermal for heating and hot water supply has become a highlight of the newly built MTK Budapest Sports Park in the middle of the former industrial area on Kerepesi Street in Budapest. The geothermal heating system complements the nearly 1000 solar panels that provide 500 kW of electricity to the facility, combining for a pioneering energy system focused on sustainability and reliability. Work on the MTK Sports Park started in 2023 and has been headed by [Bayer Construct Zrt](https://bayerconstruct.hu/en/). The complex was built on almost 100,000 square meters of land and includes a multifunctional hall, indoor garage, and outdoor courts. Geothermal heat is supplied by a deviated production well drilled to 1300 meters depth. Heat from the water is recovered, then the water goes back to the subsurface via a reinjection well. On the surface, both wells are located right next to each other. By using directional drilling, the wells are spaced at a distance of almost 1000 meters in the subsurface. The geothermal heating scheme of the MTK Sports Park represents the first geothermal supply agreement signed by the [ Regulated Activities Supervisory Authority](https://sztfh.hu/) (SZTFH), under the new legislation that stipulates that thermal water extracted for geothermal utilization must be injected back into the geological medium. This legislation [came into force in March 2023.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/hungary-amends-laws-to-create-geothermal-framework/) The project was also an important milestone for the construction company Bayer Construct, as it is their first project to use a geothermal-based heating system.

groundlink-energys-vision-for-sustainable-geothermal-growth-in-vanuatu.md,https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/groundlink-energys-vision-for-sustainable-geothermal-growth-in-vanuatu/,Groundlink Energy’s vision for sustainable geothermal growth in Vanuatu,Carlo Cariaga,7 Jul 2025,"Groundlink Energy is building on industry experience, existing geologic data, and harmonious community relationships to pave the way for geothermal in Vanuatu. Geothermal is considered a game-changing opportunity for small islands, offering energy self-sufficiency and potential for economic growth. Such opportunities have already been explored in the Caribbean islands, and early efforts are underway in the small island groups of the Canary Islands, Greece, and Indonesia. Founded by four individuals with collective experience in geothermal development, drilling, environmental science, and finance, Australia-based Groundlink Energy aims to put together a portfolio of geothermal projects across the Pacific region. For the team, Vanuatu stood out because of the quality of the potential resource and the impact that the project could have on the local community and economy. _“We prioritized Vanuatu because we are confident in the potential resource,”_ explained Mr Horneman._“We are also confident that we can make a positive impact to the people and the economy of Vanuatu through the reduction of power costs, reduction of emissions, and reducing the dependence on diesel as the primary source of energy.”_ A signal of strong support from the government is also a major reason for the developer to pursue a project site in Vanuatu. When Prime Minister Jotham Napat came into office, he prioritized geothermal as part of the government’s 100-day plan. Ministers Rick Tchamako Mahe and Ralph Regenvanu, along with their respective departments, have also shown strong support for the initiative. With Vanuatu part of the joint bid between South Pacific Nations and Australia to jointly host COP31 in late 2026, the project has the potential to showcase regional climate leadership on a global stage. _“It’s a very fertile and supportive environment in which to develop a geothermal project.”_ added Mr Horneman. This is not the first time that geothermal development has been attempted specifically in the Takara site in North Efate. Another Australian company has shown interest in the project since 2009 but ultimately abandoned the project in 2016, citing various challenges including lack of electrical infrastructure connected to the project. Today, the project benefits from a new and supportive regulatory regime and developments in the domestic market. However, one of the most important changes is supporting infrastructure is now in place. The power transmission network now extends to the project site, and the power lines pass all the way across the granted permit area. This means that there is no longer a large investment needed to get the power to the market. _“We applaud all of the previous development efforts. They have completed some high-quality work, and their previous progress has helped to de-risk the project for us,”_ further added Mr Horneman. Based on past geoscientific work, the inferred geothermal resource has a capacity of 83 MW at P50 probability. A geothermal resource with temperatures of between 150 to 190 °C is expected at 500 meters depth. There is also a potential 300 °C resource at around 1500 meters depth. This will, of course, have to be validated by exploration drilling. _“There is far more generation capacity potential from this project than what there is current domestic demand, and that capacity could be in the hundreds and hundreds of MWh capacity,”_ said Mr Horneman. The company sees the potential excess power generation capacity as an opportunity for developing the project beyond the current domestic demand. This means that the project can help bring in new industries, such as data centres, to boost economic activity in Vanuatu. There are also nearby mining deposits that can be harnessed with mining operations powered by geothermal. Other industries requiring low-cost, low-emission electricity may also be attracted to the island. _“We have early stage offtake discussions underway, and an existing MOU in place with one particular outfit for power supply in the vicinity of 10 MW. Our plans to connect the project directly with fibre optic cables opens up almost limitless potential to host data centers that have strong demand for power and cooling.__We have further opportunities to explore such as carbon credits, processing local limestone for cement, green hydrogen production to displace diesel on nearby islands, and more.__“_ Mr Horneman added. The company has also committed to targeting a high percentage of local content for their project. This means providing direct employment to the locals, and engaging with as many domestic contractors and suppliers as possible. **The value of community engagement** A crucial element of implementing large-scale infrastructure projects in remote communities and small islands is securing the support of the local community. In the case of Efate, previous efforts on geothermal development have paved the way for community engagement at the Takara site. _“These previous efforts have raised the awareness in Vanuatu of the opportunity and potential of geothermal power,”_ explained Mr Horneman. Still, the company has been hard at work in communicating with the local communities, and providing a platform for them to voice their questions and concerns. In May 2025, Groundlink Energy [secured consent for the project](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/takara-vanuatu-geothermal-project-secures-community-consent/) from the local communities following a public consultation event. _“It was great to see the welcoming culture. We were pleased to share our plans and, at that meeting, the endorsement was provided to Groundlink to proceed with its exploration program. We have a really warm relationship with the local communities now, and we want to maintain those good relationships to keep them informed and supportive of our activities,”_ said Mr Horneman. _“For me, [community engagement] is a real priority, not only for being a good developer, but it’s a personal passion to create a strong ongoing connection with local communities and relationships built on trust.”_ Groundlink Energy is targeting an exploration drilling program, possibly with slim hole and core hole wells, next year. Before this, the team will revalidate the geological information with new surveys and update a geological model. Pre-submission for updated environmental approvals are currently underway. Discussions on power offtake and community engagement will continue to progress during this time. Currently, the priority for the company is raise capital and form joint ventures with other investors and players to accelerate the development program. The company is accepting expressions of interest from investors and other industry representatives to co-develop the project. Groundlink Energy is also looking into a number of prospective permit sites in neighboring countries, and will seek to secure those once enough momentum has built in Vanuatu.

Vulcan Energy has officially resumed district heating supply from the Landau geothermal heating plant to [EnergieSüdwest](https://energie-suedwest.de/) (ESW), the utility company of the city of Landau (Landau in der Pfalz) in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Initially, Vulcan will supply a maximum heat output of 2 megawatts (MW), depending on demand. This is equivalent to about 320 households. Landau’s mayor Dr. Dominik Geißler, mayor Lukas Hartmann, ESW board member Dr. Thomas Waßmuth, and Dr. Horst Kreuter, founder and general representative of Vulcan Energie Ressourcen GmbH, gave the official launch at an on-site meeting at the heating plant. The geothermal energy will be fed directly into the neighboring ESW heating plant, from where ESW will distribute it to the Landau South district heating network. The heat output from the geothermal source will be gradually expanded with the goal of making the Landau South district heating network almost entirely climate-neutral by the 2026-2027 heating season. Until now, the Landau South district heating network has been supplied mainly by gas-fired boilers and two combined heat and power plant operated by ESW. There are also plans to integrate the inner-city district heating network in the future. _“It’s fantastic that, thanks to[ the takeover and renovation of the geothermal power plant by Vulcan Energy](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/vulcan-to-streamline-geothermal-lithium-operations-in-germany-with-acquisition/), district heating from climate-friendly geothermal energy can finally be supplied to Landau households again. With the start of heat supply, we are taking an important step towards climate-neutral heat supply in Landau,”_ said Dr. Dominik Geißler, Mayor of Landau. _“Municipal heat planning is showing us the way forward – and deep geothermal energy is a key component. The fact that we can now supply the first households in the south of Landau with geothermal heat is a strong signal for our energy future.”_ _“The resumption of geothermal heat supply is also a significant milestone for EnergieSüdwest AG. We can now use our existing networks in Landau-Süd, as well as in the area of ??the former slaughterhouse, as originally planned, to supply our customers with geothermal district heating. In the medium term, we will be able to supply our existing networks 100 percent with this energy based on the power plant on Eutzinger Straße and even expand it,”_ added Dr. Thomas Waßmuth, CEO of EnergieSüdwest AG. The Landau geothermal power plant started operations in 2007 and was the first geothermal power plant in Rhineland-Palatinate. At the time, the power plant was owned by Pfalzwerke and Landau-based energy supplier Energie Sudwest. Problems in the Landau geothermal power plant manifested early on. Earthquakes were reported in the region, resulting in damage to houses. Eventually, the power plant had to throttle its output and no longer operated economically. By 2013, the Daldrup company took over the Landau power plant. By 2014, seismicity was also felt in the grounds of the power plant and damaged train tracks. The State Office for Geology and Mining then decided that the power plant had to be shut down temporarily as a precaution. Subsequent studies revealed that geothermal fluids from one of the two wells contaminated the groundwater in the area. The Daldrup company repaired the borehole damage before the State Office gave the go-ahead for final recommissioning. In 2019, there was another change in ownership as Daldrup[ company sold both the Landau and Taufkirchen power plants](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/daldrup-sohne-ag-concludes-complete-sale-of-taufkirchen-and-landau-geothermal-plants/) to IKAV Invest S.ar.l., Luxembourg. Vulcan has plans to further expand the geothermal infrastructure in the Landau region with five additional drilling sites and a total of up to 24 new wells planned to be drilled. Heat from these wells will then be fed into the district heating network. These plans are essential to the HEAT4LANDAU project, which is supported by [a funding commitment of up to EUR 100 million](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/vulcan-secures-federal-funding-for-geothermal-heating-project-in-landau-germany/) from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection. In addition to the heat transfer from the Landau geothermal heating plant to ESW, the thermal water is now also being piped to the neighboring [lithium extraction optimization plant (LEOP),](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/german-chancellor-visits-vulcans-landau-geothermal-and-lithium-extraction-facility/) where Vulcan extracts sustainable lithium for battery production. In this way, the company combines sustainable energy generation with the creation of regional added value. _“With the resumption of geothermal heat supply to ESW, Vulcan is setting another milestone for a sustainable heat supply for Landau. Vulcan’s integrated project demonstrates how the efficient use of renewable resources both strengthens the local heat supply and supports the European battery industry through the extraction of green lithium,”_ said Dr. Horst Kreuter, founder and general representative of Vulcan Energie Ressourcen GmbH.","district heating, EnergieSüdwest, ESW, Geothermal, geothermal lithium, Geothermie, Germany, heating plant, Horst Kreuter, Landau, Landau in der Pfalz, Lithium extraction, Rhineland-Palatinate, Vulcan Energy","Vulcan Energy has resumed district heating supply from its Landau geothermal plant in Germany, delivering up to 2 MW, enough for approximately 320 households, with plans for expansion toward climate-neutral operation by 2026-2027. Key actors include Vulcan Energy, EnergieSüdwest (ESW), and local government officials. The geothermal facility, originally operational since 2007 and historically plagued by seismicity and groundwater contamination issues, was acquired by Vulcan following previous ownership changes and technical setbacks. The project aims to integrate geothermal heat into Landau’s district heating network, which has been primarily supplied by gas and combined heat and power plants, thus reducing fossil fuel reliance. Vulcan’s broader strategy includes adding five drilling sites and 24 new wells, supported by EUR 100 million from the German government’s HEAT4LANDAU initiative, with a focus on sustainable energy and regional lithium extraction for battery manufacturing.

pantelleria-emerges-as-sicilys-geothermal-hotspot.md,https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/pantelleria-emerges-as-sicilys-geothermal-hotspot/,Pantelleria emerges as Sicily’s geothermal hotspot,Alexander Richter,11 Apr 2025,"The island of Pantelleria may become a leader in geothermal development in Sicily, highlighting new opportunities for sustainable energy and local growth. The Italian island of Pantelleria is emerging as a key location for the development of geothermal energy in Sicily, with experts pointing to its unique geological conditions as ideal for low-impact and sustainable energy production. Located between Sicily and Tunisia, the island is of volcanic origin and has long been recognized for its geothermal activity. A recent initiative led by the [University of Catania](https://www.dfa.unict.it/), in collaboration with the Italian National Research Council (CNR) and the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV), is exploring the possibility of harnessing this potential to support local decarbonization and energy independence. _“Pantelleria offers a rare opportunity to develop geothermal energy with minimal environmental impact, and in a way that benefits both the island and the broader Sicilian region,”_ said Prof. Flavio Cannata, geophysicist at the University of Catania. With support from the [Italian Ministry of Environment and Energy Security](https://www.mase.gov.it/) (MASE) and regional authorities, the project aims to create a model of small-scale geothermal energy production that can be replicated in other parts of Sicily and beyond. Pantelleria’s geothermal system is considered ideal for a “binary cycle” plant, which does not release emissions into the atmosphere and has a low surface footprint—making it especially suitable for areas with natural and cultural value. The ongoing research includes geophysical surveys, well monitoring, and environmental assessments to better understand the island’s geothermal reservoir. The results are promising and point toward a sustainable, long-term resource capable of supplying clean, baseload energy to the local grid. **Why Pantelleria matters for geothermal in Italy** Italy has long been a leader in geothermal energy, with the Larderello region in Tuscany being the world’s first site of geothermal electricity production. However, there is now growing interest in expanding geothermal development across southern Italy and the islands, where volcanic activity presents significant untapped potential. Pantelleria may become the “southern front” of Italy’s geothermal renaissance—contributing to decarbonization goals, reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels, and offering a resilient solution to energy supply in island environments. **For the geothermal sector** Pantelleria is a prime example of how academic institutions, public agencies, and local communities can collaborate to unlock geothermal potential in a responsible and innovative way. The island’s initiative sets a precedent for sustainable energy development in sensitive regions, opening doors for future investments and public-private partnerships across the Mediterranean. We previously reported on efforts to explore the [geothermal potential of Sicily](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/?s=Sicily).","Geothermal, Italy, Pantelleria, potential, Sicily","Pantelleria island in Sicily is emerging as a key site for geothermal energy development, driven by its volcanic origin and unique geological conditions conducive to low-impact, sustainable power generation.

A new report published by [Project InnerSpace](https://www.projectinnerspace.org/) and [Future Ventures](https://future.ventures/) presents that geothermal can provide power for data centers at a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) competitive with a combined-cycle natural gas based on a theoretical 1-GWe geothermal energy project in the Western United States. The analysis presents a pathway to reducing the LCOE of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) to approximately USD 50/MWh within the next 10 to 15 years through investment, policy support, technology transfer from oil and gas, and ongoing advancements in technology, [Click here to access the full report,**“From Core to Code: Powering the AI Revolution with Geothermal Energy.”**](https://projectinnerspace.org/resources/Powering-the-AI-Revolution.pdf) The report complements[ a previous paper published by the Rhodium Group](https://rhg.com/research/geothermal-data-center-electricity-demand/) which states that geothermal[ can economically provide up to 64% of the US data center energy needs](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/could-geothermal-meet-rising-data-center-electricity-demand/). At $50/MWh, a theoretical 1-GW geothermal energy project can undercut nearly all combined-cycle natural gas plants. However, the estimate is based on the application of investment tax credits (ITCs). Without such benefit, the LCOE of the geothermal project will increase to $119/MWh. This is still significantly better than Lazard’s current estimates for nuclear power, which is at $140/MWh. The report acknowledges that the continuance of ITCs remains uncertain based on potential policy changes in the United States. The authors argue that if the government chose to invest $10 billion (half of annual US oil and gas subsidies), then the subsequent unsubsidized LCOE for EGS would fall below the media of combine-cycle natural gas within 10 years. Thus, ensuring that tax credits remain intact for geothermal is critical in ensuring the growth of next-generation geothermal.","data centers, EGS, enhanced geothermal systems, Future Ventures, Geothermal, LCOE, power plant, Project Innerspace, Report, Tax Credits","A report by Project InnerSpace and Future Ventures highlights that enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) could provide cost-competitive power for data centers, with a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) around USD 50/MWh within 10-15 years, based on a theoretical 1-GW project in the Western United States.

Notably, geothermal could meet up to 64% of the US data center energy demand, potentially surpassing nuclear costs at USD 140/MWh. The report suggests that a government investment of $10 billion—comparable to half of US oil and gas subsidies—could reduce the LCOE below natural gas prices within a decade, contingent upon continued policy support for ITCs.

Various exploratory drilling efforts have already been undertaken in and around the Amersfoort region in the province of Utrecth in the Netherlands to characterize its subsurface and potential geothermal resources. By the end of the year, the national [SCAN](https://scanaardwarmte.nl/) program will decide if further seismic surveys will be necessary to advance the research. This follows on exploratory drilling previously done in [De Bilt](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-research-drilling-begins-in-de-bilt-netherlands/), Ede, and [Ouder-Amstel](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/permit-granted-for-geothermal-exploratory-drilling-in-amsterdam-netherlands/), as well as previous seismic surveys. To actually extract geothermal energy, more information about the deep subsurface is needed. This includes, among other things, the depth of the existing strata and the presence of faults. The target area of the seismic survey is the region northeast of the province of Utrecht, as shown below. The first step of this supplementary research is to further map the subsurface and align it with the above-ground heat demand. Some of the necessary data for this is already available. Currently, studies are still ongoing into both the subsurface suitability and the heat demand. The research results are expected by the end of 2025. It will then be determined whether the seismic survey will take place, and if so, where exactly. SCAN aims to complete the accompanying plan by the end of 2025. If the seismic survey will push through, it will likely happen in 2026. The exact timing cannot be indicated yet, as the availability of the contractor and the breeding season of animals in the region need to be considered. f seismic surveying proves feasible, it will be further coordinated with municipalities and water boards. Local residents will receive additional information prior to the survey.","De Bilt, Drilling, Ede, exploration, Geothermal, Geothermie, Netherlands, Ouder-Amstel, SCAN, Seismic survey, Utrecht","In the Netherlands' Utrecht province, further seismic surveys are under consideration to enhance geothermal resource assessment following recent exploratory drilling in areas including De Bilt, Ede, and Ouder-Amstel. The initiative is part of the national Scan program, which aims to determine the necessity of additional seismic investigations by the end of 2025. Current efforts focus on mapping the deep subsurface to identify suitable geothermal conditions, such as strata depth and fault presence, crucial for geothermal energy extraction. These surveys target the region northeast of Utrecht and are essential for finalizing geothermal development plans aligned with local heat demand. The potential seismic survey, tentatively scheduled for 2026, depends on logistical factors, including contractor availability and environmental considerations such as local wildlife breeding seasons. Successful implementation would involve collaboration with municipalities and water authorities, with local community engagement planned.

In the US, several Utah lawmakers and representatives of geothermal developers and operators made the case for improved government support for geothermal development during an oversight field hearing held by the House Committee on Natural Resources, Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources in Cedar City, Utah. Long permitting times remained the core issue of the hearing, with permits for development on federal land possibly taking more than 10 years to be granted. Behind California and Nevada, Utah is the 3rd state in the US with the largest installed geothermal power generation capacity. The scales are massively skewed however – California and Nevada account for more than 90% of the United States’ capacity, while Utah contributes only 3.2%. Utah Republican Rep. Celeste Maloy argues that geothermal has remained underappreciated and underutilized, and that the lack of investment in geothermal does not match its scale of opportunity. Maloy has proposed the Geothermal Energy Opportunity Act, which gives the US Department of Interior only 60 days to process a geothermal drilling permit. Tim Latimer, CEO of [Fervo Energy,](https://fervoenergy.com/) echoed the woes of long permitting times. _“Today, 90% of geothermal resources lie on federally managed land, but permitting can take up to a decade, much longer than equivalent wind, solar, oil and gas projects. That needs to change.”_ Paul Thomsen, Vice President of Business Development at [Ormat Technologies.](https://www.ormat.com/en/home/a/main/), added the [interagency conflicts](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/ormat-to-downsize-dixie-meadows-geothermal-project-nevada/) further add to the delays caused by long permitting. For instance, the US Fish and Wildlife Services has threatened the Department of Interior with a lawsuit following the granting of geothermal permits that may compromise certain fish species. Thomsen added that he was confident that geothermal permitting can still be done in an environmentally safe manner, even if it was expedited. Beaver County in Utah is famously the site of [the Fervo Cape project](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/blm-announces-project-approval-and-permitting-changes-to-promote-geothermal/), which seeks to established Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) using technologies developed in the shale gas drilling industry. The company has been very successful in securing off-takers for the power from the project, but with California-based utilities such as with [Southern California Edison](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/fervo-signs-320-mw-geothermal-ppa-with-california-utility/), [Clean Power Alliance](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/fervo-adds-18-mw-to-ppa-for-geothermal-power-with-clean-power-alliance/), and [Shell Energy](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/fervo-signs-31-mw-geothermal-ppa-with-shell-energy/). The slow construction of transmission lines, also burdened by federal regulations, has also been a challenge for developing geothermal power facilities. Jake Garfield, deputy director of the Utah Office of Energy Development, recounted that it has taken 16 years to permit the construction of a long transmission line from Wyoming to southern Nevada. _“If we see delays like that for transmission, we’ll never see the full buildout of Utah’s geothermal potential,”_ Garfield concluded. Further, Garfield called on the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to offer up more parcels of land for geothermal lease in Utah. Garfield stated that the BLM has put up more than 160,000 acres of land in Utah in the last five years, but has also offered more than 700,000 acres in Nevada in the same timeframe. A recent BLM geothermal lease sale in Utah succeeded in generating over USD 5.6 million in high bids for 14 parcels. It set a record for generating the most revenue per acre compared to any previous geothermal lease sales on BLM public lands in Utah, indicating higher investor interest for geothermal projects in the state.","BLM, Bureau of Land Management, Cedar City, Celeste Maloy, federal land, Fervo Energy, Geothermal, government, Hearing, House Committee on Natural Resources, Legislation, Ormat Technologies, Paul Thomsen, permitting, Policy, Tim Latimer, Utah","In Utah, lawmakers and geothermal industry leaders are advocating for streamlined federal permitting to unlock the state's substantial geothermal potential, which is underdeveloped compared to California and Nevada, contributing only 3.2% of US capacity. The core issue cited is permit delays exceeding 10 years on federal lands, impeding project development and supply chain integration. Prominent figures, including Utah Rep. Celeste Maloy and Fervo Energy CEO Tim Latimer, highlighted bureaucratic hurdles, interagency conflicts, and environmental review delays, despite 90% of geothermal resources being on federal land. Maloy proposed the Geothermal Energy Opportunity Act, aiming to limit permit processing to 60 days. Utah’s Fervo Cape project in Beaver County exemplifies successful development using Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) technology, developed from shale gas drilling techniques, with strong utility off-take agreements, including Southern California Edison. However, transmission infrastructure delays, exemplified by a 16-year permit process for a Wyoming-Nevada line, threaten full resource utilization. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is urged to increase geothermal leasing in Utah; recent sale activities generated over USD 5.6 million, indicating growing investor interest.

The [Cascade Institute](https://cascadeinstitute.org/) has published a report that provides guidance on harmonized and effective geothermal regulations across Canada, thus providing a regulatory roadmap for Canada to harness its vast geothermal potential. The report also looks into international best practices on geothermal regulation, particular from the 10 largest geothermal power producers globally. **[Click here to read the full report, “Groundwork: Regulatory Guidelines for Making Canada a Geothermal Powerhouse.”](https://cascadeinstitute.org/technical-paper/groundwork/)** As the Carney government accelerates major energy infrastructure projects, geothermal is notably absent in Canada’s push for clean and secure energy sources. A major hurdle for this is regulatory, or more specifically, the lack of regulations in most of the country that covers geothermal energy projects. Despite Canada’s[ vast geothermal potential](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/cascade-institute-publishes-roadmap-for-ultradeep-geothermal-power-in-canada/) and world-class drilling expertise, Canada lags far behind the rest of the world, and ten provinces and territories still lack basic geothermal project regulations. Where frameworks do exist, they are inconsistent from one province to the next—making it difficult to launch projects at scale. Drawing lessons from the world’s top ten geothermal power producers, the report provides provinces and territories with actionable guidelines they can use to establish effective regulations to kickstart the nascent industry. _“Geothermal delivers the clean, secure, and always-on power that Canada needs in this time of upheaval,”_ said Emily Smejkal, Policy Lead for the Cascade Institute’s Geothermal Energy Office (CI-GEO) and the report’s lead author. _“We have the technical expertise, we have the resource potential, and now, with this report, we have guidelines to shape effective regulations.”_ International Geothermal Association CEO Marit Brommer said, _“The Cascade Institute’s Groundwork report is a timely and effective intervention that addresses Canada’s biggest challenges head-on. It presents clear, transferable, and future-proof principles that jurisdictions across the country can adopt or adapt immediately.”_ The comprehensive study analyzed regulatory frameworks from the world’s top 10 geothermal producers—including the United States, Indonesia, Philippines, New Zealand, and Iceland—to identify proven approaches that have successfully launched geothermal industries. The report identifies six regulatory best practices common across successful geothermal nations— precise definitions, technology-agnostic regulations, efficient permitting processes, acreage maximums to limit monopolies , realistic timeframes for development, and early public engagement. _“Countries that adopt these regulatory principles have already unlocked billions in geothermal investment globally,”_ said Smejkal. _“Canada has fallen behind, but it’s not too late to catch up.”_ Global geothermal investment is projected to reach US$2.5 trillion by 2050, and Canada’s [oil and gas sector drilling expertise](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/spe-event-to-facilitate-important-conversations-for-geothermal-in-canada/) provides a natural competitive advantage in geothermal development. The report represents Phase 1 of a broader initiative to accelerate geothermal power development across Canada. Cascade Institute’s Geothermal Energy Office, in coordination with industry ,governments, and the International Geothermal Association, will use this report as a springboard for developing detailed model regulations that jurisdictions can adapt and implement. _“The federal government is prioritizing fast-tracked energy projects and federal-provincial coordination, and geothermal can and should lead the way, if we address these regulatory gaps,”_ said Smejkal. _“We’ve identified what works globally and translated it into solutions Canada can use now. We have everything we need to seize this opportunity.”_","Canada, Cascade Institute, Emily Smejkal, Geothermal, IGA, International Geothermal Association, Marit Brommer, Policy, regulation, top 10","The Cascade Institute has released a report titled “Groundwork: Regulatory Guidelines for Making Canada a Geothermal Powerhouse,” which outlines strategic regulatory recommendations to accelerate geothermal energy development across Canada.

The document, **“From the Ground Up – A draft strategy to unlock New Zealand’s geothermal potential”** was launched as part of this year’s [New Zealand Geothermal Week](https://www.taupo.biz/nzgeothermalweek2025) held in Taupo and organized by [Amplify](https://www.taupo.biz/) and the [New Zealand Geothermal Association](https://www.nzgeothermal.org.nz/) (NZGA). _“Today, geothermal accounts for just under 20 per cent of our electricity generation. We are the fifth largest generator of geothermal in the world. Unlike hydro, wind or solar power, it isn’t reliant on the weather, and provides a clean, consistent and resilient power source,”_ said Jones in a speech during the launch event. _“Beyond electricity generation, direct geothermal energy is an enabler of industrial, commercial and agricultural activity. Currently there is over seven petajoules in direct geothermal heat use in pulp and papermaking, wood processing, dairy manufacturing and greenhouses each year.”_ Despite geothermal being closely tied with the history of New Zealand, there are still several factors that are holding back its further growth. The Minister cites the lack of centralized exploration data, the lack of information for investment decision-making, and outdated regulations as some of the major factors. To address these gaps, the draft strategy proposes a number of actions with defined timelines. The action plan goals can be classified as such: * Improving access to geothermal data and insights * Ensuring regulatory and systems settings are fit for purpose * Advancing knowledge and uptake of geothermal technologies * Enabling place-based geothermal clusters * Driving science, research and innovation, including supercritical geothermal technology The Minister makes special mention of the progress that New Zealand has made in the realm of supercritical geothermal. In late 2024, the Government of New Zealand announced that [it has ringfenced $60 million from the Regional Infrastructure Fund](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-zealand-to-invest-60-million-on-supercritical-geothermal-research/) to support this sector. Some $5 million has now been drawn down from the budget for work on the detailed design and cost to drill the first of three exploratory deep wells in the Taupo Volcanic Zone. Discussions are still ongoing to narrow down the site for the first well, and drilling is expected to started in 2026.","action plan, Amplify, draft, Geothermal, investment, Legislation, New Zealand, New Zealand Geothermal Association, New Zealand Geothermal Week, NZGA, NZGW, regulation, roadmap, Shane Jones, strategy, Supercritical","New Zealand has released a draft geothermal strategy, “From the Ground Up,” aiming to double geothermal energy use by 2040, with consultation now open via the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment.

The [United States Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/) (USGS) highlights the electricity generating potential using Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) technology in the Great Basin region in the United States, encompassing the entirety of Nevada and parts of California, Utah, Arizona, Oregon, and Idaho. The data indicates a current best provisional estimate of 135 GWe from the upper 6 kilometers of the Earth’s crust. The new report is an update to a 2008 assessment done by USGS on the geothermal potential of the Great Basin. Provided new technologies and more refined scientific understanding, the USGS deemed it proper to do an updated evaluation. The Energy Act of 2020 also directed the USGS to update or conduct new assessments of geothermal resource in the conterminous United States, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Following are the links to the materials related to the study: * [Short report and factsheet](https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2025/3027/fs20253027.pdf) * [Data files and map files](https://doi.org/10.5066/P14LU7WD) The study notes that continued technological improvement can greatly increase the potential power production from EGS, possibly to more than ten times the base estimate. This can also be increased improving the conversion efficiencies of power plants, although this was not considered in the estimates. Conversely, there is a wide margin on uncertainty in the estimates, related to the uncertainty of models of several physical parameters (~45%) and uncertainty to the portion of the geology that could be developed using EGS technologies. (more than 1000%). Thus, these estimates have to be treated with caution and discussed at the proper levels of nuance. As technologies are demonstrated and understanding of three-dimensional geology is improved, uncertainty will decline. If technologies continue to improve, then viable EGS resource estimates will increase because more heat is accessible for the generation of electricity. _“USGS assessments of energy resources are about the future,”_ said Sarah Ryker, acting director of the USGS. “ _We focus on undiscovered resources that have yet to be fully explored, let alone developed. We launched this work in the Great Basin because of the area’s history of geothermal activity – and we found even more potential for baseload power than had previously been known. Leveraging this work along with artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques will help us assess the entire nation’s potential for geothermal energy with greater speed and accuracy.”_ **[RELATED: Utah FORGE extended circulation test confirms EGS connectivity and heat extraction](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/utah-forge-extended-circulation-test-confirms-egs-connectivity-and-heat-extraction/)**","EGS, Enhanced Geothermal System, Geothermal, Great Basin, modeling, Nevada, potential, research, United states Geological Survey, USGS","The USGS has released an updated assessment of Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) potential in the Great Basin region of the United States, covering Nevada, parts of California, Utah, Arizona, Oregon, and Idaho.

The report, prompted by legislative directives under the 2020 Energy Act, emphasizes that ongoing technological advancements and improvements in power plant efficiency could increase this potential by over tenfold, though current estimates carry significant uncertainty (~45%) due to limitations in geological modeling. As EGS technology matures and geological understanding improves via AI and machine learning, exploitable heat resources are expected to expand, enhancing US energy resilience and renewable capacity. These findings suggest substantial future growth in geothermal power, with implications for US energy policy and infrastructure development.

With 57 affirmative votes from the 60 members of the Legislative Assembly, the new Geothermal Energy Law of El Salvador has been approved. This follows [the proposal made by President Nayib Bukele](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-bill-proposes-private-investment-in-el-salvador-geothermal-sector/) through the Ministry of Economy. The law has 83 articles, providing a robust framework for geothermal development in El Salvador, particularly for the granting of concessions to private companies. The following are some of the highlights of the Geothermal Energy Law: * Geothermal concessions may be approved for private investors through public bidding, or in some cases without public bidding, for up to 30 years. * The [General Directorate of Hydroelectric and Mining Energy](https://www.dgehm.gob.sv/) (DGEHM) will conduct public tenders for areas with geothermal potential. * In some cases, concessions may be granted without public bidding. Direct awarding is possible for projects declared of national interest by the DGEHM, “when it is justified that their development is strategic for energy security, economic development, and/or national well-being.” * The concession must be approved by the Legislative Assembly. * Interested parties must submit exploration plans to the DGEHM. The agency then has 45 days to decide on exploration requests. These can be granted for up to 36 months for up to 50 square kilometers. The companies doing exploration will have preferential rights. * The DGEHM will supervise and oversee compliance with the concession contract during its execution, construction, generation, operation, or abandonment. * Individuals or companies holding concessions or making new investments in geothermal generation projects will be exempt from Income Tax, Import Duties, and all types of taxes on income from the sale of reduced emission certificates or renewable energy, among others. * Foreign concessionaires must establish a company in El Salvador. * The law allows for expropriations of areas with geothermal potential. Some members of the Legislative Assembly voiced their criticisms of the law. For instance, Claudia Ortiz of the VAMOS party, criticized the provision for the direct awarding of contracts, saying that does not favor transparency and may increase the risk of corruption. Representative Francisco Lira also pointed out that the bill was not consulted with academics, experts, and members of the communities. However, amendments made based on these opposing views were not passed. One article was deleted upon the request of Representative Dania González, which identified the fields of Ahuachapán, Berlín, Chinameca, San Vicente, Obrajuelo, Conchagua, Chilanguera, and Santa Rosa de Lima as “exploitation rights areas” currently exploited by CEL or its subsidiaries.","CEL, concession, DGEHM, El Salvador, geotermia, Geothermal, Geothermal Energy Bill, LaGeo, Legislation, Nayib Bukele, regulation, tender","El Salvador's Legislative Assembly has enacted the Geothermal Energy Law, with 57 of 60 votes, establishing a legal framework to facilitate private sector geothermal development.

The General Directorate of Hydroelectric and Mining Energy (DGEHM) oversees tender processes, with exploration permits issued for up to 36 months covering 50 square kilometers. The law prioritizes development by offering tax exemptions for domestic and foreign investors, requiring foreign firms to establish local entities. It authorizes expropriation of geothermal areas, raising concerns about transparency and potential corruption, as critics argue the provision for direct awarding bypasses competitive bidding. Notably, some community and expert consultation was bypassed, and certain existing exploitation rights areas were excluded from the new legal protections.

A research team led by Associate Professor Sadiq J. Zarrouk, co-director of the [University of Auckland’s Geothermal Institute](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/engineering/our-research/engineering-research/research-areas-and-facilities/geothermal-institute.html), has begun drilling beneath the city of Auckland in New Zealand to evaluate how geothermal heat can be used to complement home and business heating systems. Working in collaboration with water well drilling company [Drill Force NZ Ltd](https://www.drillforce.co.nz/), the team is collecting temperature data from a well in Takanini to assess the feasibility of using geothermal to cut water heating costs in households and businesses. The project could transform how buildings are heated by tapping into a sustainable and underused energy source, says Zarrouk, and could save households up to $20 per month, based on the average water heating costs of a typical household. _“The long-term vision is to make the technology low-cost and simple to implement in both new builds and existing buildings. The goal is to see it adopted widely as a clean, cost-effective energy solution,”_ said Zarrouk. The technology works by drilling a shallow well near the property and running a water pipe through it. As the water flows through the pipe, it absorbs natural heat from the ground. This raises the water temperature by a few degrees, meaning less electricity is needed to heat it to the desired level – ultimately reducing overall energy use and power bills. A special phase-change material that is used to efficiently store and distribute thermal energy will help to balance energy demand during peak usage times, according to Zarrouk. The research team installed 15 sensors in the well to monitor temperature changes down to 20 metres below ground level. The data is being analysed using machine learning tools to help optimise the design of a second well, which is due to be drilled in the coming months. Both wells will be monitored over the next year to better understand seasonal temperature behaviour. If results are promising, heat extraction systems will be installed to test the technology further. _“As the first study of its kind in Aotearoa New Zealand, this research has the potential to change the country’s energy use, paving the way for more sustainable and affordable heating options. If successful, the findings could provide long-term scientific and practical benefits, reducing reliance on traditional power sources,”_ says Zarrouk. **[RELATED: New Zealand tissue and toilet paper company shifts to 100% geothermal](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-zealand-tissue-and-toilet-paper-company-shifts-to-100-geothermal/)**","Auckland, Drill Force NZ, exploration, feasibility study, Geoexchange, Geothermal, heating, New Zealand, Sadiq Zarrouk, shallow geothermal, University of Auckland","A research team led by Associate Professor Sadiq J.

With plans to further expand the current geothermal district heating network, the city of Szeged, Hungary are undertaking a project to reduce methane gas emissions for all subsequent geothermal drilling operations. Thermal waters hosted in the Great Plain (Alföld) contain a relatively large amount of gases, including methane. Since methane is considered a major greenhouse gas, even more so than carbon dioxide, the project aims to prevent its release into the atmosphere. The goal now is to separate the methane, dry it, and burn it as natural gas. Thus, the project will also produce additional energy. While there is currently no legislation that prohibits the release of methane gases, it is expected that such a regulation will be in power by 2027. To fund this program, [Geo Hoterm Kft](https://geohoterm.hu/), along with the city district heating company, secured an investment of nearly HUF 1 billion (approx. USD 3 million) from the Swiss Fund following a tender. Dániel Mészáros, project manager of Geo Hoterm, further said that they have submitted two applications for [the recently launched Jedlik Ányos Program](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/hungary-to-open-tender-for-geothermal-transition-of-district-heating-operations/) for connection of the thermal circuits, and for the use of heat pumps for lower-temperature thermal water.

After testing of a 2500-meter geothermal research borehole in Gluszyca, Poland, the flowrate of the well was evaluated to be too low to support plans for municipal heating and a geothermal pool. However, the commune is looking into the possibility of using the mineralized water for medicinal or balneological applications. Drilling of the geothermal research well in Gluszyca[ started in March 2024](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/drilling-of-geothermal-research-well-starts-in-gluszyca-poland/). Poland’s [National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management](https://www.gov.pl/web/nfosigw-en) (NFOSiGW) funded a large part of the project with a PLN 15.4 million (approx. USD 4.3 million) grant. Although the bottom hole temperature was measured at 75 °C, the temperature at the surface was less than 20 °C. This is mainly because of a very low flowrate of only 0.3 m3/hour. Thus, it is not possible to use the well for space heating. The commune is currently looking into the option of utilizing the medicinal properties of the water. “ _On the one hand, experts are persuading me to conduct the tests again, because they may be different from the first ones. Secondly – these mineral waters that we have may indicate that Gluszyca may slowly think about going to spa waters, because there are similar waters in Swieradów-Zdrój, with exactly similar parameters,”_ said Roman Glod, the Mayor of Gluszyca. Researchers are also looking into the possibility of installing a downhole heat exchanger, or even attempting another well testing program.

The maintenance project involved a complete overhaul of the rotor, which is the rotating shaft of the turbine, with extensive repairs. The two stages of the rotor that had suffered the most damage were welded up and rebuilt. New blades were manufactured and installed with great precision where needed. The generator armature was also rewound. Significant repairs were then made to the turbine’s structural frame – the support system that keeps this heavy piece of equipment stable and safe in operation. Finally, a complete inspection of the entire engine assembly was carried out. _“We anticipate that these improvements will significantly extend the life of the equipment, improve efficiency and strengthen the security of energy production,”_ says Lýður Skúlason, Managing Director of HD’s Energy and Environment Division. Aside from the repair work, HD also did a complete upgrade of the computer equipment and sensors critical to the operations of the turbine complex. Finally, a precise balancing of all equipment was carried out under full load, i.e. the equipment was run at maximum capacity and fine-tuned to ensure that no imbalance caused vibration or wear. This is another milestone as this marks the first time that domestic contractors did a complete balancing of a geothermal turbine in Iceland. _“It is important to build domestic maintenance and response capacity to ensure the operational security of energy infrastructure,”_ commented irna Björnsdóttir, Director of Energy Production at Orka náttúrunnar._“Sustainable maintenance is not just an advantage but a key component in reliable and safe operations.”_ **[RELATED: HD ehf signs equipment contract for expansion of Svartsengi geothermal, Iceland](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/hd-ehf-signs-equipment-contract-for-expansion-of-svartsengi-geothermal-iceland/)**","engineering, generator, Geothermal, HD ehf, Lýður Skúlason, maintenance, ON Power, Orka Náttúrunnar, power plant, turbine","HD ehf. has completed a complex turbine overhaul and upgrade at an Icelandic geothermal power plant operated by ON Power, marking a significant milestone in domestic geothermal maintenance capability.

As it is firmly outside of our field of expertise, we are refraining from making any comments on these political affairs. This report is based only on the facts published by Nicaraguan agencies in official documents, as well as developments directly relevant to the geothermal industry._ The Attorney General’s Office (PGJ) of Nicaragua has officially canceled the contract for the exploitation of geothermal resources at the Momotombo plant due to corruption and money laundering charges brought to the owners of the operating company, Momotombo Power Company. The owners of the company, retired General Álvaro Baltodano Cantarero, and his son, Álvaro Baltodano Monroy, have been accused of creating 20 shell companies used for money laundering and tax evasion. According to the statement by PGJ, the evidence gathered by the National Police and the Attorney General’s Office revealed a direct connection between Momotombo Power Company and the shell companies. Such companies were established in foreign jurisdictions classified as tax havens by the Financial Action Task Force. Moreover, the Ministry of Energy and Mines stated that the Momotombo Power Company failed to execute the works agreed upon the exploitation contract, which obligated the company to expand its operating capacity to 37-40 MW. Exploitation of geothermal resources at the Momotombo site started in 1983 with the operations of the 35-MW Momotombo 1 power plant. This was followed in 1989 with a 35-MW Unit 2 power plant, and an 8-MW binary unit that came online later. Despite having an installed capacity of about 78 MWe, productivity of the Momotombo geothermal field has been unstable since 1987. As of 2013, the operating capacity at Momotombo was stated to be only 25 MWe. In 2013, [Ormat Techologies sold its stake of the Momotombo geothermal power project](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/ormat-sells-stake-in-momotombo-plant-in-nicaragua-for-7-5m/) to the Momotombo Power Company. With the revocation of the contract, the assumption is that ownership and management of the existing geothermal power facilities revert to the national government via the state-owned Nicaraguan Electricity Company (ENEL). The statement by the PGJ went to say that _“the State of the Republic of Nicaragua reiterates its commitment to the defense of the National Heritage, transparency in public management, and the strengthening of the rule of law, ensuring that energy services continue to be provided without interruption and under lawful and responsible management.”_ _“Corrupt individuals who, using domestic or foreign corporate structures, disguise themselves as investments to cover up crimes will not be tolerated; accordingly, all those responsible, whether individuals or legal entities, domestic or foreign, will be prosecuted,”_ the statement further says.","acquisition, Geothermal, Momotombo, Momotombo Power Company, Nicaragua, power plant","Nicaragua's Attorney General’s Office has officially canceled the exploitation contract for the Momotombo geothermal power plant due to allegations of corruption and money laundering.

The geothermal site originally included two 35-MW units and an 8-MW binary unit, with productivity issues since 1987. In 2013, Ormat Technologies sold its stake in the project to the Momotombo Power Company. The revocation implies that ownership and management will revert to the Nicaraguan government, specifically the state-owned Nicaraguan Electricity Company (ENEL). This move underscores efforts to combat corruption and ensure energy services continue under lawful management, highlighting government commitment to transparency, although it signals potential instability in the geothermal energy sector in Nicaragua.

The Commercial Court in Zagreb, Croatia has opened bankruptcy proceedings against Geo Power Energy Development doo, the owner and operator of the 16.5-MW Velika Ciglena geothermal power plant. With this, account of owner Dragan Jurilj with an amount of EUR 19.7 million has been blocked and subjected to legal supervision. The Velika Ciglena geothermal power plant [was inaugurated in 2019](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/croatias-first-geothermal-plant-officially-inaugurated/), then under Geoeon doo, a partnership between Turkish company MB Holding (80%) and Dragan Jurilj (20%). The company Geo Power Energy Development was eventually created as a result of reorganization of Geoeon. At the time, the plant had a 10-MW power purchase contract with[ Croatian Energy Market Operator](https://www.hrote.hr/) (Hrvatski operator tržišta energije d.o.o. / HROTE), accounting for the electricity consumption of about 29,000 Croatian households. With several government officials, including an ambassador from Türkiye, in attendance, the inauguration of the Velika Ciglena power plant was perceived as a strong driver for further geothermal development in Croatia. MB Holding even expressed an intention to invest in more geothermal projects in the country, specifically eyeing the Legrad site. The output of Velika Ciglena did not quite reach its full potential, with the power plant “temporarily” halting operations in 2022. It has not resumed operations since then. Several legal disputes have happened between MB Holding and Jurilj since Velika Ciglena started operating. The allegations have gone both ways. The Turkish partners has filed criminal charges against Jurilj, stating that they have effectively been kicked out of the partnership through the use of falsified documents. Moreover, MB Holding alleges that Jurilj as siphoned off tens of millions of Euros from the company Geoeon. For his part, Jurilj also filed several criminal charges against MB Holding, stating that the company also falsified documents, specifically the minutes of an official company assembly. There are also allegations of unjustified payments from the funds of Geoeon that were paid by HROTE, as well as making fraudulent transactions. The conflict between the two parties have been elevated to arbitration, with Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic and Turkish President Erdogan said to have discussed it during an international summit. In 2021, the legal dispute was brought to the European Court of Human Rights Due to the ongoing legal dispute concerning the Velika Ciglena power plant, HROTE suspended the payout of state subsidies to the company. The project was due to receive more than EUR 130 million of state incentives until 2031. HROTE made a proposal to the court to establish a court deposit for the remaining state incentives, but the proposal was denied. The decision was made in February 2022, thus resulting in the halting of operations of Velika Ciglena. Moreover, Jurilj has accused HROTE of paying an amount of HRK 25 million into a foreign account. Without access to payments from HROTE, Jurilk expressed the difficulty of making tax payments related to the project. The proposal to open bankruptcy proceedings was made by HROTE on September 2025. Jurilj opposed the decision, stating that the company will lose its status as a privileged electricity producer if it goes into bankruptcy. This means that the electricity offtake contract with HROTE will be automatically lost. Jurilj argues that this is not a standard bankruptcy case since his company delivered electricity to HROTE, but payment were made into a court deposit rather than the company’s account. However, HROTE retorts that the final decision states that the debtor is not entitled to compensation, but instead has more obligations to the agency. The bankruptcy proceedings will likely continue to develop over the coming months, but the case of Velika Ciglena is an unfortunate entry in the promising story of [growing geothermal momentum in Croatia](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-resource-above-100-c-confirmed-after-drilling-at-osijek-croatia/).","bankruptcy, Bjelovar, Croatia, Dragan Jurilj, Geothermal, HROTE, legal dispute, MB Holding, ownership, power plant, Velika Ciglena","The Velika Ciglena geothermal power plant in Croatia, with a capacity of 16.5 MW, has entered bankruptcy proceedings following a protracted legal dispute involving its operator, Geo Power Energy Development doo, and its Turkish partner, MB Holding.

pioneering-geothermal-use-for-coffee-production-in-kamojang-indonesia.md,https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/pioneering-geothermal-use-for-coffee-production-in-kamojang-indonesia/,"Pioneering geothermal use for coffee production in Kamojang, Indonesia",Carlo Cariaga,16 May 2025,"The story of using geothermal steam for drying of coffee beans in Kamojang, Indonesia is an example of models exploring other applications of geothermal energy. At more than 40 years of operations, the Kamojang geothermal production field of [PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy](https://www.pge.pertamina.com/) (PGEO) in West Java is one of the most important geothermal sites of Indonesia. It is also a site of innovation for geothermal utilization, as it is the birthplace of the world’s [first coffee processed using geothermal steam.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-heat-being-used-for-coffee-processing-in-indonesia/) Muhammad Ramdhan Reza Nurfadilah, also known as Mang Deden, is the pioneer behind this innovation. Since 2023, Deden, together with local entrepreneurs, has been harnessing the natural wealth of his hometown with support from PGEO. Before coming up with the innovative process, Deden had already been running a coffee business since 2015. With a café that was a popular gathering place for locals and PGE employees to relax and share stories, Deden began to establish a good relationship with the employees of PGE Kamojang Area. This closeness developed through casual conversations often filled with discussions about coffee, from the production process to the potential for developing local coffee. These discussions eventually evolved into a concrete idea when PGEO expressed interest in starting a coffee development program, which Deden enthusiastically welcomed. _“At that time, I considered the idea to be a challenge. I saw geothermal potential as an opportunity to provide solutions to various problems faced by conventional coffee producers,”_ he explained. Together with PGEO, Deden conducted intensive research to identify the fermentation techniques best suited to the geothermal characteristics used in coffee processing. _“I conducted fermentation research for almost a year. From more than 20 processes we tried, we finally found three that best fit the characteristics of the drying process,”_ he said. Following the research, Deden began producing coffee using Arabica beans grown in the highlands of Kamojang, at an altitude of around 1,500 meters above sea level. He then empowered local coffee entrepreneurs to build a more efficient business ecosystem through the use of _‘Geothermal Dry House’_ technology, which utilizes geothermal steam from PGEO’s Kamojang operations as a substitute for sunlight. This allowed for a more stable, hygienic, and high-quality drying process. From a business perspective, this technology excels by accelerating the drying time up to threefold. This translates lower operational costs and increased production capacity without additional time or expenses. _“This technology also minimizes the risk of bacterial contamination from outside sources. That way, the bacteria that affect the process only come from the fermentation before drying. In terms of taste, the end result is more fruity, with a stronger aroma, and a smoother texture compared to coffee processed conventionally,”_ he explained. Deden currently manages [Geothermal Coffee Process](https://www.instagram.com/gcp.idn/) (GCP) as Managing aDirector, where he collaborates with PGEO to empower coffee farmers in Kamojang. GCP processes post-harvest coffee beans into green beans, partnering with over 80 farmers and absorbing 20 tons of coffee last season. Moving forward, Deden aims to develop GCP into an integrated business that delivers a broader social and economic impact for the community. In the first year of its launch, Deden mentioned that there were parties from abroad interested in replicating this system._“We felt it was important to patent it immediately. Rather than having this concept adopted by external parties first, it’s better for us to develop it domestically. We want the Indonesian people, especially in coffee-producing areas close to geothermal sources, to be the first to implement a similar concept,”_ Deden hoped. This is what fueled Deden’s spirit to introduce geothermal coffee as an original Indonesian innovation to the global stage. His efforts paid off, as GCP succeeded in penetrating international markets with exports to Japan. This year, the company aims to expand exports to Europe. _“From the beginning, my friends at PGE Kamojang have always believed in me and encouraged me to keep trying new things. This collaboration is not just about inventing the world’s first geothermal coffee, but also about opening doors for us, local entrepreneurs, to grow, learn, and dream bigger. We are increasingly experiencing the benefits of geothermal energy, not just as a source of electricity in our homes, but also as a door that opens up opportunities for a better life,”_ he concluded. With a background as a vocational high school graduate in pharmacy, Deden is now exploring the opportunity to pursue a bachelor’s degree through a scholarship program from PGEO. He has chosen to major in business management, aiming to realize his dream of building a sustainable enterprise.","coffee, Deden, drying, GCP, Geothermal, geothermal coffee, Geothermal Coffee Process, heating, Indonesia, Java, Kamojang, panas bumi","In 2023, PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy’s (PGEO) Kamojang geothermal field in West Java facilitated an innovative application of geothermal energy for coffee processing. Local entrepreneur Muhammad Ramdhan Reza Nurfadilah, known as Mang Deden, developed a method to dry Arabica coffee beans using geothermal steam, reducing drying time by up to threefold and enhancing product quality—resulting in more aromatic, fruity coffee with improved hygiene and reduced bacterial contamination. This process leverages PGEO’s geothermal resources to create a more efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable drying technique, enabling the processing of 20 tons of coffee last season with partnerships involving over 80 farmers. The technology, embodied in the ‘Geothermal Dry House,’ is in the early commercial deployment stage, with intentions for patenting and broader domestic adoption. Export efforts include initial shipments to Japan and plans to expand into Europe, positioning Indonesia as a pioneer in geothermal-assisted coffee processing. This development exemplifies how geothermal energy can diversify beyond electricity generation, fostering social and economic growth in local communities and opening new international markets.

A composite pipe material, co-created by Finnish companies [QHeat](https://www.qheat.com/) and [Exel Composites](https://exelcomposites.com/), has been shown to improve borehole energy efficiency by 10% at one QHeat’s geothermal wells at the site of the Lounavoima waste-to-energy plant. The glass fiber reinforced polymer (GRFP) material was proven to be suitable to the pressure and temperature conditions of underground applications, while providing the insulating capacity to improve energy efficiency in heat transfer. The energy saved by improving the plant’s storage efficiency equates to the heating requirements of 700 detached houses per year. _“The composite collector pipes improved the energy production and storage capacity of Lounavoima’s borehole by nearly 10 percent compared to the previous solution,”_ said QHeat CEO Erika Salmenvaara. The tailored composite collector pipes were developed to meet the Lounavoima plant’s specific needs, while also focusing on durability, sustainability, and recyclability. The collector pipes needed to withstand their own weight two kilometers underground, while also insulating heat to ensure energy isn’t lost during transfer. Exel’s composite solution rose to the occasion, being metal-free, light-weight, optimized for flow and insulation, and recyclable. The choice of fiberglass might seem unconventional compared to acid-resistant steel or plastics. However, traditional materials weren’t a good fit for this case: metals conduct heat, and plastic lacks the mechanical strength required at such depths. Composite materials can be applied well beyond geothermal energy, in areas such as wind and solar power, where their performance characteristics – lightness, insulation, corrosion resistance and long lifetime – deliver major benefits. This supports, among others, industries driving the green transition. The collaboration between the two parties was described as a “natural fit.” Exel Composites’ R&D department worked closely with QHeat’s engineers to tailor the composite tubes to the job’s specific environmental and performance requirements. The two teams went through several iterations, optimizing for sizing, connection methods, and thermal insulation vs mechanical strength trade-offs. Exel designed and manufactured the collector pipes, which QHeat installed using specialized tools While QHeat owns the solution and patent for the geothermal well technology, Exel’s R&D team and decades of composites expertise played a crucial part in the co-creation project. Both parties were equally impressed by each other’s expertise. _“We got to work ambitiously and openly on a product that has the potential to launch us into new business areas and markets. We could demonstrate that the composite pipes have an estimated 50-year lifecycle and can be responsibly disposed of at the end of it,”_ said Pertti Kainu, Product Business Owner at Exel Composites. The collector pipe project showcases how Finnish engineering and collaboration can accelerate the green transition. Designed, tested, and manufactured entirely in Finland, the Lounavoima collector pipes reflect both companies’ roots, but their sights [are set firmly on international growth](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/finnish-geothermal-company-targets-international-expansion/). QHeat is expanding in the Nordics and EU, while Exel’s international factories support smooth collaboration across markets. _“We’re taking QHeat’s thermal wells abroad, and Exel can bring their product development professionals into our international projects,”_ commented Salmenvaara.","composite material, efficiency, Exel Composites, fiberglass, Finland, Geothermal, Lounavoima, QHeat, storage","Finnish companies QHeat and Exel Composites have co-developed a glass fiber reinforced polymer (GRFP) composite pipe that enhances borehole energy efficiency in geothermal applications.

A new scholarly article by [Professor Gabriel Eckstein of Texas A&M University School of Law](https://www.law.tamu.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/gabriel-eckstein.html) is stirring debate in the geothermal sector, raising critical questions about who owns the heat beneath our feet – and how the absence of clear legal ownership could hinder geothermal development in the United States. Titled “[Who Owns Heat? Property Rights in Geothermal Energy](https://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Eckstein.pdf)”, the article, published in the University of Illinois Law Review, dives into the complex legal status of geothermal heat as a non-tangible, incorporeal natural resource. While landowners typically hold rights to oil, gas, and water beneath their property, Eckstein argues that the law remains largely unsettled when it comes to thermal energy. _“Geothermal energy is not a substance like water or minerals—it’s a condition or characteristic of subsurface formations,”_ Eckstein writes. “Without clear rules of ownership, the legal foundation for investing in geothermal remains shaky.” The article examines both federal and state law, showing how different U.S. states classify and regulate geothermal resources in inconsistent ways – some treating it as a mineral, others as water, and a few as a sui generis resource. It also reviews private property theories, tort doctrines like trespass and nuisance, and the rule of capture – suggesting that outdated legal frameworks may not match the realities of subsurface heat extraction. At the heart of the paper is a call for legal clarity. Eckstein argues that defining property rights in geothermal energy – whether private, public, or common – could unlock greater investment, improve regulatory consistency, and help accelerate the deployment of this underutilized baseload renewable energy source. Read the full paper here: [Who Owns Heat? Property Rights in Geothermal Energy – University of Illinois Law Review](https://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Eckstein.pdf) As the U.S. ramps up interest in geothermal, particularly through enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) and direct use heating applications, this legal scholarship could serve as a catalyst for state and federal policy reform—aimed at reducing risk and encouraging development.

The proposed technology is being tested at the laboratory scale in different rock types to verify its ability to liquefy and vitrify rock, ensuring the borehole is ready for heat exchange immediately after drilling. Laboratory demonstrations provide crucial data to assess the technological, environmental and economic sustainability of the proposed solution, while also defining its potential and commercial viability. The high-risk innovation presented in DeepU has the potential to make geothermal energy system accessible everywhere in a targeted and demand-oriented manner, offering a complementary approach and an alternative solution to traditional energy storage and production, decentralising the power supply also in areas where this is currently deemed uneconomic. DeepU has been funded by the European Commission under the EIC Pathfinder Programme (G.A. 101046937) as part of Horizon Europe. Eng. Luc Pockelé coordinates the project from the RED srl in collaboration with partners from four countries: the University of Padua (Italy), Prevent GmbH (Germany), Fraunhofer IAPT (Germany), GeoServ (Ireland), The Wroclaw University of Science and Technology (Poland), and the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche IGG (Italy). The project will run until October 2025. Just recently, the DeepU project held a webinar titled **“Does deep drilling need a revolution?”** The webinar brought together experts and stakeholders to examine the current state of [deep drilling](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-drilling-in-szaflary-poland-terminates-at-6103-2-meters-depth/) technologies while initiating a discussion on the breakthroughs necessary to access ultra-deep geothermal resources. Central to the conversation was the pioneering technology proposed by DeepU – its approach combines high-power lasers and cryogenic gas to penetrate the most challenging rock formations. The project partners showcased cutting-edge, innovative drilling technologies while emphasizing the advantages of non-mechanical drilling. They shared significant findings from the DeepU project that demonstrate, on a laboratory level, the potential of laser drilling technology to address the limitations of conventional methods. The research investigates how lasers interact with rock, revealing that thermal spallation, melting, and vaporization occur simultaneously, albeit with varying intensities based on rock type, power density, and irradiation duration. Notably, thermal spallation is the most promising to produce usable diameter wells, with drilling rates ranging from 5 to 15 meters per hour. The team has selected supercritical nitrogen as the flushing medium for deep borehole drilling due to its thermodynamic properties and effectiveness in removing cuttings. They developed a numerical model to determine the necessary pressure and flow rates for different borehole depths, which is being validated through a dedicated test rig. The proposed system involves storing liquid nitrogen, compressing it to high pressures (up to 350 bars), and delivering it down the borehole through a specially designed channel with vacuum insulation. Among the challenges discussed regarding the technology is the need for integration with existing drilling equipment and practices. **[The presentations and the recording of the webinar are available on the project website.](https://www.deepu.eu/index.php/events/)**","cryogenic gas, deep drilling, DeepU, Drilling, European Commission, Geothermal, Horizon Europe, laser drilling, non mechanical drilling, research, Technology, U-tube, Webinar","The DeepU project, funded by the European Commission under Horizon Europe (G.A. 101046937), is developing advanced laser and cryogenic gas-based drilling technology aimed at revolutionizing deep geothermal energy extraction beyond 4 km depth. Led by RED srl with partners including the University of Padua, Fraunhofer IAPT, Prevent GmbH, GeoServ, Wroclaw University, and CNR Italy, the project seeks to create a vitrified, waterproof U-tube heat exchanger by integrating laser fracturing and cryogenic fluid dynamics. Laboratory demonstrations have shown laser drilling can achieve rates of 5-15 meters per hour through thermal spallation, vaporization, and melting, with supercritical nitrogen used as a flushing medium. This approach aims to overcome limitations of mechanical drilling, offering faster, more precise borehole creation in challenging rock formations. The technology's implications include enabling remote, cost-effective geothermal exploitation and expanding energy access in regions where traditional methods are not economically viable. Ongoing validation involves developing numerical models for pressure and flow management at various depths, with full-scale deployment targeted by October 2025.

Drilling in Krýsuvík [started in April 2025](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/hs-orka-commences-geothermal-exploration-drilling-at-krysuvik-iceland/). Drilling operations are being done by [Iceland Drilling](https://www.jardboranir.is/), using the Odin electric drill rig. In this first exploration drilling, a slightly shallower well was drilled than originally 2750 meters depth planned. Well KR-10 was drilled to a TVD of 2200 meters with a MD of 2600 meters. The results of the first drilling indicate high geothermal potential in the area, although it is too early to say whether it will be exploited. However, these initial results raise hopes that the area can be used for geothermal exploitation in the near future. The well is now allowed to heat up so that further testing can be done to evaluate the temperature, pressure, and volume of geothermal fluid for further decision-making. Exploration drilling in Sveifluháls is based on the agreement signed between the Hafnarfjörður Municipality and HS Orka in June 2024 in connection with the potential utilization of geothermal resources in Krýsuvík. The agreement aims to explore the possibility of harnessing geothermal energy and extracting groundwater in the land of Krýsuvík in an economical and environmentally friendly manner, in parallel with the development of a resource park where further utilization of process streams can take place. Preparation for drilling of the next well, KR-11, is already ongoing. It is planned in the area just north of Bleikhól and planning changes for the well are currently being made in collaboration with Hafnarfjörður Municipality. The geothermal development in Krýsuvík is expected to provide security to the supply of hot water in the Suðurnes region., as the area currently predominantly relies on supply from the Nesjavellir hydroelectric power plant and the Hellisheidi hydroelectric power plant in the Hengil area. The Krýsuvík area has so far been highly regarded as a geothermal area for energy production. There are hopes that it will produce hot water for Hafnarfjörður and the capital region, as well as electricity for the national grid.","Drilling, Geothermal, heating, HS Orka, Iceland, Iceland Drilling, KR-10, Krysuvik, Suðurnes, Sveifluhals","In April 2025, Iceland Drilling completed exploration drilling at Sveifluháls in Krýsuvík, Iceland, employing the Odin electric drill rig.

interview-ensuring-geothermal-representation-in-the-eu-policy-agenda.md,https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/interview-ensuring-geothermal-representation-in-the-eu-policy-agenda/,Interview – Ensuring geothermal representation in the EU policy agenda,Carlo Cariaga,8 Sep 2025,"In this interview, Malte Nyenhuis of Innargi discusses the opportunities for geothermal advocacy at the EU level and the importance of industry representation. _After many years being somewhat overlooked at EU level, the large potential of geothermal energy has started to be recognised by policymakers in Brussels. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen highlighting geothermal at the World Economic Forum in Davos and the commitment of EU Energy Commissioner Dan Jørgensen to come forward with a Geothermal Action Plan are clear signs._ _This development is the result of an increased awareness among many players in the sector that geothermal must step up its policy work at EU level if it wants to be seen at equal footing with other renewables. To learn more about the state of EU policies on geothermal and what it will take for lobbying efforts to create tangible results, we spoke with Malte Nyenhuis, Head of EU Affairs at[ Innargi](https://innargi.com/de/)._ When I joined Innargi almost two years ago, a political momentum in favour of geothermal was starting to build up. Consequently, the European Parliament, the European Council of the Region, the European Economic and Social Committee and the EU Council in 2024 all [called on the incoming European Commission to present a Geothermal EU Action Plan](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/european-council-calls-on-measures-for-the-faster-deployment-of-geothermal/) – the first ever EU policy document focused on geothermal – alongside strategies on Heating & Cooling and Electrification. This momentum was to a large extent triggered by the changing energy policy context: While fighting climate change remains high on the EU agenda, energy security as well as stable and affordable prices have become the top priorities. Policymakers across political parties have started to understand that geothermal energy as a local renewable and 24/7 available source can significantly contribute to all three goals. However, the first challenge is to keep this positive momentum throughout 2025. It is mainly a year of strategies and agenda setting for the new European Commission and European Parliament. Many other stakeholders are trying to push their issue in the political narrative leading up to the legislative proposals for the so-called “post-2030 framework” which should ensure that the EU will meet its 2040 climate target currently under discussion. As geothermal we must make sure that we are seen as indispensable part of the solution across Europe. And secondly, while it is very positive that an EU Geothermal Action Plan has been announced, it is not yet carved in stone that it will be a fully fledged document in its own right or rather a footnote to the Heating & Cooling and Electrification strategies. The geothermal sector needs to translate it’s often technical and academic expertise into concrete policy messages and proposals which fit the current political debates about EU’s competitiveness and security while continue to increase its visibility in Brussels. Overall, the biggest driver for the large-scale uptake of geothermal energy are the EU climate and renewable targets which require the stepwise phase-out of fossil fuels in district heating. This is complemented by country-specific circumstances. In Denmark, for example there is an increasing awareness of the negative implications of biomass, e.g. import dependencies, price variability and questions regarding its sustainability. [With our projects in Poland,](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/innargi-and-veolia-group-partner-for-geothermal-heating-in-lodz-poland/) we understand that using the countries own resource and air quality improvements rank very high. However, despite the huge potential in many European cities to replace fossil fuels in the existing district heating system or to newly connect customers with individual oil and gas boilers like [our project with Vestforbrænding will do in Greater Copenhagen](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/agreement-signed-to-deliver-geothermal-for-district-heating-in-greater-copenhagen-denmark/), barriers remain that also EU can help to overcome. In all our markets we experience very high public acceptance based on early on and open communication with local stakeholders and citizens. At the same time, permitting procedures and timelines differ a lot within but also between countries. This is partly due to a lack of experience with geothermal projects, different national mining laws that were often not made with geothermal in mind with a risk of different interpretation, and EU legislation which is handled differently e.g. on the environmental impact assessment. Political support from the EU level is a helpful first step to make the national and local decision makers more aware of geothermal. More could be done at EU level with regard to easier access to subsurface data as a key tool for de-risking investments, guidelines and possible geothermal-specific rules for permitting and by opening and better recognising geothermal and the modernisation and expansion of district heating in the various EU funding tools. Already in 2019, when Ursula von der Leyen presented the EU Green Deal, it was about fighting climate change by transforming the EU into a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. As described above and looking at the Draghi report, this objective has become even more important even though some of the wording has changed. For geothermal to be part of this, it means that the sector needs to bring across its relevance across the EU as well as its business case in terms of attracting private investments and contributing to EU’s policy objectives. That is why Innargi has hired me as Brussels representative: To increase the visibility and to make sure that developers and operators have a seat at the policy table. The good thing is that geothermal is very versatile: It can be shallow or deep, and it has a lot of applications from electricity and heating to storage and critical raw materials. However, this often results in fragmented and not necessarily very loud voices. To be heard and give concise input to EU policy makers, a strong and more consolidated voice of the sector building on concrete project and business experience is needed. The[ European Geothermal Energy Council](https://www.egec.org/) (EGEC) as the long-standing and recognised association is well placed to live up to this task. However, speaking from my experience with other major EU energy associations this requires a structured integration and coordination of members views. That’s because the European Commission, when drafting policy documents or legislation, wants very concrete input based on the real-life experience from companies. Compared to the utilities sector and other renewables, there are hardly any larger or even big players active in geothermal. And if so, it is very small part of their overall business if we look e.g. at Engie or EnBW. That is why Innargi has been active in Brussels since very early on to bring market knowledge as well as technical and economic feasibility insights to the table. And that is why EGEC needs to have a strong voice that includes the project implementation and business-driven perspectives. Politics depends on a lot of external factors, and you never know what might suddenly happen which will impact the policy agenda. This is what I like a lot about my job. But politics also goes in circles, people come and go as do issues. For this reason, we constantly must educate people about geothermal and to push for it to be on the agenda. Another key challenge is the link between Brussels and what happens in the different markets. Talking about faster permitting at EU level is one thing – everyone likes that. But how can we actually best navigate and work with the different national interpretations of EU rules (e.g., on state aid and permitting)? This is another important role of EGEC, to facilitate and foster the exchange and mutual learning of the different companies active in Europe. The Energy Council conclusions from the end of last year and the initiatives in many EU Member States and regions show the growing openness and political will to advance geothermal energy There is no doubt that the announced EU Geothermal Action plan together with the Heating & Cooling and Electrification Strategies are a major opportunity to accelerate and scale-up geothermal across Europe. At the same time, it is important that the EU energy and climate policy framework for the time after 2030 gives a strong signal to market players and local decision-makers for investments in geothermal. The starting point is the adoption of an EU climate target for 2040 followed by a renewables target and measures to achieve them. Geothermal has a lot to offer for EU’s and national overall policy objectives. For policymakers to understand and be aware, concrete proposals based on close collaboration by everyone in the sector as well as progress on concrete projects all over Europe is needed. At this pivotal moment, stronger structures and voices in Brussels are key – and EGEC is central to that effort. _For a wider perspective of the current state of geothermal in Europe, including research, projects, and policy support, make sure to[register for the upcoming European Geothermal Congress](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/registration-now-open-for-the-2025-european-geothermal-congress/), taking place in Zurich, Switzerland on 6-10 October 2025._ Tags SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE * Follow Think GeoEnergy * [About Us](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/about/) * [Terms & Condition](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/about/terms-conditions/) * [Privacy Policy](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/about/privacy-policy/) * [Advertisement](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/advertisement/) * [Our Advertisers](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/our-advertisers/) * [Support](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/support-us/) * [ENGLISH](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/) * [EN ESPAÑOL](http://www.piensageotermia.com/) * [IN TURKISH](http://www.jeotermalhaberler.com/) All rights reserved. © ThinkGeoEnergy ehf. 2025 We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The European Parliament, European Council, and related bodies in 2024 called for an EU Geothermal Action Plan, marking the first dedicated policy document for geothermal, to be aligned with heating, cooling, and electrification strategies. This momentum reflects a shift from prior neglect, emphasizing geothermal’s role as a local, 24/7 renewable resource capable of reducing reliance on fossil fuels, especially in district heating. Industry advocates, including Malte Nyenhuis of Innargi, emphasize the need for sector consolidation, technical and business expertise translation into policy proposals, and EU-level support such as easier access to subsurface data and streamlined permitting. The sector faces challenges like varied permitting procedures across countries, limited large-scale companies, and fragmented advocacy efforts—necessitating stronger representation, notably through the European Geothermal Energy Council (EGEC).

Geothermal energy is playing a crucial role in decarbonizing district heating. At the forefront of this transition is [Innargi](https://innargi.com/de/), a leading European geothermal developer dedicated to decarbonising heat—one community at a time. With the economics of geothermal energy demanding a swift transition from design to heat production, where tighter budgets necessitate faster project timelines, Innargi is setting a new benchmark for this with two large-scale geothermal projects in the city center of Aarhus and [North of Copenhagen.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/innargi-enters-framework-agreement-for-geothermal-district-heating-in-copenhagen-denmark/) Impressively, [their first geothermal plant in Aarhus](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/construction-to-begin-at-innargis-geothermal-heating-plant-in-aarhus-denmark/) is planned to deliver its first heat in September 2025, just 26 months after the seismic acquisition ended—showcasing the speed and efficiency needed to make geothermal a scalable and impactful clean energy solution. Once completed, these projects will collectively deliver over 130 MW of heating through 19 geothermal wells, reducing CO2 emissions by more than 165,000 tonnes annually. Emil Stürup-Toft, Lead Geoscientist at Innargi, and Claudio Strobbia, Chief Research Scientist and CEO of [RealTimeSeismic](https://realtimeseismic.com/) (RTS), shared their insights on these pivotal geothermal exploration campaigns, showcasing what it takes to image the subsurface and scale geothermal energy to this level in two of Denmark’s largest cities. _“Before acquiring seismic data, we were operating with limited subsurface knowledge in Copenhagen. We knew geothermal potential existed—thanks to a well drilled 25 years ago that had performed beyond expectations —but we lacked certainty about the extent of the geothermal system. Seismic wasn’t a deciding factor in whether to pursue the project, but rather a crucial tool to confirm our geological model.”_ Emil explained. _“We needed to verify whether the productive system extended far enough north and south, as we had hoped. We also knew a basin-bounding fault ran through the center of Copenhagen, but we required precise imaging of its location, as this fault significantly influences geothermal potential on the city’s eastern and western sides._ _“Seismic data proved invaluable in identifying areas with geothermal potential and refining our understanding of the system’s extent. A positive surprise was that the system stretched even farther than expected, both north and south, reinforcing confidence in our development plans._ Emil also commented on the need for seismic in Aarhus:_“In Aarhus, the seismic survey played a critical role in refining our drilling strategy within the pre-selected area for geothermal development. With the site already contracted, the data was essential for pinpointing the most suitable drilling locations, ensuring optimal well placement, and minimizing geological risks._ _“The seismic data helped us avoid potential hazards, ensuring we didn’t accidentally drill into a fault, which could have had undesirable consequences, ranging from increased operational costs and reduced reservoir efficiency to potential loss of well integrity.”_ _“In the most densely populated areas of Denmark, in the height of summer, where tourism activity added to the complexity of our operations, we placed seismic receiver nodes across the city centres, including in front of landmarks like Tivoli Park and the Danish Parliament,”_ explained Emil. _“It was one of the most challenging environments you can imagine for good quality seismic acquisition.”_ Securing approvals and gaining buy-in from local stakeholders before the survey began was relatively seamless, thanks to the proactive communication strategy applied, the modern technology used during the survey, and their flexible approach to survey design and acquisition operations. To address any public concerns, Innargi leveraged TV, radio, and newspapers to inform the public, reassure them about how minimally invasive the survey would be, and emphasize the long-term benefits of clean heating that would be available to them in just a few years. This transparent approach led to minimal concerns from the public during the acquisition phase. The use of [STRYDE](https://stryde.io/)’s miniature nodal seismic technology allowed RTS to record seismic data discreetly, positioning the seismic nodes along streets, in bushes, and next to trees, hidden away from the public where possible. Nodes were clearly marked with notes explaining the survey, and amazingly, less than 1% of them were tampered with. To further minimize disruption, Innargi reduced source efforts near historic and vulnerable buildings and conducted operations at night, ensuring minimal disturbance to the local community. As a result, the survey was virtually invisible to most passersby or local residents. The only indication that a survey was taking place was when the Vibroseis trucks passed quickly through the streets at night for the source operations. _“We were pleasantly surprised by how few nodes were tampered with,”_ Emil noted._“People were curious but generally respectful. Some even mailed back nodes they had picked up!”_ _“The ability to deploy a dense seismic node network without disrupting road traffic or daily life in the city was crucial.”_ said Claudio Strobbia from RTS. _“We leveraged our fleet of STRYDE nodes to acquire the data efficiently.”_ Thanks to the compact size and autonomous functionality of these nodes, RTS was able to deploy a high-density array with just 10 meters between each node, all while avoiding additional costs. This dense array, combined with nighttime operations to minimize anthropogenic noise interference, resulted in data quality that exceeded expectations. _“In our experience, urban environments are notoriously challenging for seismic acquisition, but the results we obtained on these two surveys were exceptional. The combination of a dense receiver grid, long offsets, and optimized source effort enabled us to produce highly accurate subsurface images.”_ added Claudio. Once the data was acquired, RTS processed it with exceptional speed, delivering high-resolution seismic images for Innargi in record time. These insights played a crucial role in refining the geological model, mapping fault lines, and pinpointing the most promising locations for geothermal wells. RTS migrated images just hours after acquisition to conduct initial checks, with full processing completed within weeks. For the Copenhagen survey, operations wrapped up mid-June, and by mid-July, Emil, and his team were already reviewing the initial data, with the final processed versions and report completed by August. RTS’s approach contrasts sharply with traditional, larger processing firms, where the process is often found to be slower. _“Working with RTS, I experienced a highly interactive and tailored service, ensuring that queries were resolved quickly, rather than waiting for weeks on end to see results.”_ Emil commented. The success of these seismic campaigns has already translated into real-world impact. In Aarhus, Innargi’s first geothermal facility, informed by the seismic survey, is set to begin producing heat in September 2025. In Copenhagen, the data has guided site selection, which will ensure that future geothermal wells are optimally placed for maximum efficiency and longevity. _“This was a hugely rewarding project,”_ Emil reflected. _“Seeing something that started as an idea on paper transform into a fully operational geothermal plant is incredibly exciting.”_ The success of these projects highlights the transformative impact of full transparency with local communities, adaptable survey design and operations, autonomous seismic technology, and advanced data processing in urban geothermal exploration. One of the most critical factors affecting data integrity is shot point gaps. _“In urban environments like Copenhagen and Aarhus, access constraints, road bends, and infrastructure limitations made it challenging to achieve consistent shot point coverage. While missing a few nodes in a dense receiver layout is manageable through regularisation, larger gaps in shot points are much harder to compensate for, making it essential to minimize them wherever possible.”_ said Claudio. _“Looking back on how we could have further improved efficiency, reducing source effort and deploying two smaller fleets simultaneously could have improved shot point coverage while increasing acquisition speed and minimizing disruptions. While long offsets can provide valuable data, a 6 km offset was found to be sufficient for these geothermal targets, as longer distances resulted in diminishing returns,”_ added Claudio. With STRYDE’s innovative nodal technology, RTS’s expert seismic acquisition and processing, and Innargi’s geological expertise and commitment to sustainable energy development, this project serves as a benchmark for future geothermal initiatives in densely populated regions. As Europe moves toward a greener energy future, the success of these Danish projects demonstrates how advanced seismic acquisition is rapidly unlocking new opportunities in geothermal energy, helping cities transition away from fossil fuels and toward a more sustainable future.

Geothermal developer [Innargi](https://innargi.com/) has announced that it will now be delivering the target capacity of 110 MW of geothermal heating in the city of Aarhus in Denmark from only three locations, instead of the originally planned seven. The decision was based on the results of the three test wells that[ the company had started back in 2023.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/drilling-starts-for-aarhus-denmark-geothermal-heating-project/) Advancements in heat pump technology and local district heating company [Kredsløb](https://www.kredslob.dk/)’s ongoing efforts to lower temperatures in the district heating grid also make it possible to consolidate the project into fewer plants. The plan is to now establish the heating facilities in Skejbyvej, Bautavej, and Halmstadgade, while the previously proposed plants in Brokvarteret, Bjørnholms Allé, Sumatravej, and Jens Juuls Vej are being excluded. The heating plant in Skejby, which started construction in mid-2024, is expected to start supplying geothermal heat by the autumn of this year. _“Thorough analyses of all three test wells have shown that the northern part of Aarhus_ _is the most suitable for geothermal energy from a subsurface perspective. Therefore, we have agreed with Kredsløb_ _to place the geothermal plants in the northern part of the city,”_ said Sune Birk Kendrup, Project Director at Innargi. Kendrup further added that a consequence of the new plan is that two additional wells will have to be drilled in the Skejby area. This is expected to commence by 2027. Lasse Sørensen, Head of Business Development at Kredsløb, maintains that the plan is still for the whole system to be operational by 2029. At full capacity, the 110 MWth from geothermal will be enough to supply about 20% of the heat demand of Aarhus, thus replacing a substantial volume of wood pellets being burned to generate heat.","Aarhus, Denmark, district heating, Drilling, Geothermal, heating, Innargi, Kredslob, Skejby","Innargi, a geothermal developer, has revised its heat infrastructure plan for Aarhus, Denmark, reducing the project from seven to three geothermal heating plants to meet a 110 MW capacity target. This adjustment follows successful testing of three wells initiated in 2023 and is facilitated by technological advancements in heat pump efficiency and district heating system modifications by Kredsløb. The three planned plants will be located in Skejbyvej, Bautavej, and Halmstadgade, with the Skejby facility beginning construction in mid-2024 and expected to supply geothermal heat by autumn 2024. The revised strategy results from analyses indicating the northern Aarhus subsurface is most suitable for geothermal energy; hence, the project is concentrated there. To achieve full capacity, two additional wells in Skejby are planned for drilling starting in 2027, with operational goals set for 2029. This development aims to provide approximately 20% of Aarhus's heat demand, significantly reducing fossil fuel use, specifically wood pellets.

French Prime Minister François Bayrou has called on the support of banks to help ease the cost of installation of geothermal heat pumps in France. The statement was made as part of the PM’s speech during the opening of[ the 2025 French Geothermal Days in Biarritz](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/registration-open-french-geothermal-days-19-20-june-205-biarritz-france/), organized by [French Association of Geothermal Professionals](https://www.afpg.asso.fr/) (AFPG). Only one million French homes are equipped with them, with an average installation cost of €20,000, twice that of a gas boiler. The PM cites this as one of the major hurdles to wider adoption of the technology. _“The key factor is purely financial,”_ declared the Prime Minister, _“perhaps through the Caisse des Dépôts or the Banque Publique d’Investissement” (Public Investment Bank).”_ The PM stated this could erase the difference in installation costs. _“If a family is offered, for the same monthly payment but only spread out over a longer period, a heat pump rather than a gas boiler, I am sure that they will make this choice because they will save, in energy costs, the amount of this monthly payment_ ,” he further added. The current government has set a target of replacing half of gas boilers in individual homes with heat pumps within 20 years. The Prime Minister had previously cited geothermal as part of the government’s low-carbon strategy. In 2023, [the French government ](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/france-publishes-action-plan-to-accelerate-geothermal-development/)[launched an action plan](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/france-publishes-action-plan-to-accelerate-geothermal-development/) aimed at quadrupling the rate of deployment of deep geothermal projects by 2035. In a separate statement, the [Arverne Group](https://arverne.earth/en/) welcomed the announcements made by the Prime Minister during the event. In particular, the group welcomes: * **The increase of the regulatory threshold** for surface geothermal projects from 0.5 MW to 2 MW, in order to free up and accelerate projects. * **The attention given to drilling jobs** through the implementation of new training programs, as well as the relaxation of working time regulations on deep geothermal drilling sites. * **The ongoing collaboration with banks** to help individuals spread out the investment cost of a geothermal installation, as a replacement for gas boilers. * **The strengthening of the network of geothermal facilitators** in local territories, essential to raising awareness about the benefits of this still underused energy source. _“These announcements represent a decisive step. This strong signal from public authorities reinforces Arverne Group’s efforts to make geothermal energy a key driver of our energy sovereignty. The challenge now lies in swiftly turning these intentions into action to scale up geothermal solutions across France.”_ said Pierre Brossollet, founder and Chairman & CEO of Arverne Group. While this step marks a turning point, it must be part of a broader trajectory. A second set of announcements is expected in September, particularly regarding financial support. The Arverne Group hopes for: * **The strengthening of the Heat Fund** and the need to secure it over multiple years to provide operators with long-term visibility. * **The implementation of new support mechanisms** such as “Certificats d’Economie d’Energie” (Energy Savings Certificates). * **The alignment of energy taxation** with decarbonization goals, including rebalancing taxes between gas and electricity – an essential condition for the development of geothermal energy.","Arverne Group, Biarritz, district heating, Finance, France, François Bayrou, French Geothermal Days, funding, Geothermal, Geothermie, Heat Fund, Legislation","During the 2024 French Geothermal Days in Biarritz, Prime Minister François Bayrou reaffirmed France's commitment to expanding geothermal energy, emphasizing the need for financial support from banks such as Caisse des Dépôts and Banque Publique d’Investissement to lower the high installation costs of heat pumps—averaging €20,000, double that of gas boilers. Currently, only one million French households utilize geothermal heat pumps, with government aims set to replace half of existing gas boilers with heat pumps within two decades as part of a broader low-carbon strategy.

A geothermal research drilling projects near Ahnsbeck in the Celle district of Lower Saxony, Germany has achieved promising results, indicating very good geothermal potential at this location. This is considered the first successful geothermal drilling in Lower Saxony. The DemoCELL project, a collaboration between the [Georg-August University of Göttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/1.html) and [Baker Hughes](https://www.bakerhughes.com/), aims to investigate whether geothermal resources in the study site can be extracted to supply the surrounding area. The study site is part of a geothermal exploration license area [awarded to Baker Hughes back in 2023](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/baker-hughes-granted-geothermal-exploration-permit-for-ahnsbeck-germany/). The project is part of the exploration strategy of Germany’s [Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy](https://www.bmwk.de/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html) (BMWK) to investigate areas with good potential for future geothermal projects. The borehole has been successful in accessing the geothermal reservoir hosted by the Rhät sandstone at a depth of 2400 to 2500 meters. Production tests are still ongoing, but early results have been described as promising. Dr Oliver Höhn, who oversees the project as part of Baker Hughes, states that over 1000 cubic meters of thermal water have been extracted and that the temperature of the water at the wellhead was at 100 °C. During the test, the researchers measured the pressure and temperature in the reservoir and on the submersible centrifugal pump used. This data will be analyzed to determine the reservoir parameters such as temperature, permeability, and production index or injectivity index. This information will allow the team to evaluate the quantities at which geothermal energy can be extracted from the subsurface. Part of the project is the extraction of drill cores from the Rhät sandstone. Using Baker Hughes’ BETA test drilling rig, the team successfully brought a 100-meter-long core to the surface without any losses. This allows for a detailed investigation of the sandstone to determine characteristics such as permeability and storage capacity. _“We have obtained cores of a very high quality,”_ said Dr Matthias Franz, a member of the Department of Structural Geology and Geothermics at the University of Göttingen._“The average permeability that we measured on the samples is around 832 millidarcy — which would indicate that the Rhaetian sandstone is highly suitable.”_ Tests are still ongoing, but the researchers’ initial assessment is that the 44-meter thick sandstone layer is sufficiently permeable. The data from the tests will provide the basis for the potential utilization of the site. Further research is also planned in other sites in the Greater Celle area. At the end of the project, the research team aims to develop a concept for a demonstration project for medium-depth geothermal utilization.","Ahnsbeck, Baker Hughes, BMWK, Celle, coring, drill core, Drilling, exploration, Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, Georg-August University of Göttingen, Geothermal, Geothermie, Germany, Lower Saxony, permeability, research","Germany's geothermal exploration at the DemoCELL site in Ahnsbeck, Lower Saxony, has yielded promising results, marking the first successful geothermal drilling in the region.

Lithuania has potential for geothermal energy for heating, particularly in the Western region, but investment and political support will be necessary for its development. This is just one of many points that were stated by Professor Mayur Pal, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at [Kaunas University of Technology](https://en.ktu.edu/) (KTU) and Head of the [GeoEnergy Research and Innovation Lab](https://mlab-en.ktu.edu/geo-lab/) at the interdisciplinary prototyping laboratory centre M-Lab. Lithuania has already had some experience in geothermal heat operations with the Klaipeda demonstration plant in the city of Klaipeda on the western region, along the Baltic Sea Coast. Four wells were drilled for the project from 1997 to 1998, each targeting the Lower Devonian sandstone at a depth of 1000 meters. The facility was built in 2000 and supplied heat to an existing district heating network. Technical difficulties were encountered in Klaipeda since the start of operations. Gypsum precipitation was observed, along with a continuous drop in injectivity. The flowrates, both for production and reinjection, were well below the expected figures. Remedial measures were done over the following years, including the drilling of a sidetrack well, chemical treatment, and radial jet drilling. These resulted in only marginal improvements. By 2017, the operator Geoterma shut down operations and declared bankruptcy with over EUR 3 million in debt. Still, the experience in Klaipeda proved that temperatures in the Devonian aquifers were high enough to support heating, albeit they are too low for electricity generation. Pal notes that geothermal resources at depths of 1000-1500 meters in western Lithuania have temperatures of about 45–46°C and are hosted in high-porosity sandstone layers. _“Deeper, at about 2–2.5 thousand metres, other sandstone deposits are found, with temperatures reaching around 96°C. These layers are theoretically more suitable for electricity generation, but their quality depends heavily on the location: in central Lithuania, these deposits have better porosity and permeability, while in western Lithuania, these properties are poorer,”_ Pal further added. Despite the limitations of the geothermal resource, Pal states that Lithuania could become a leader for geothermal in the Baltic region. It is also a strategic option for energy development, as the use of geothermal for heating could reduce the country’s dependence on imported electricity and gas. _“A few hundred MW from Cambrian geothermal systems could offset electricity imports, and Devonian aquifers could replace the use of biomass or gas in district heating networks.”_ _“Geothermal energy could make up 5–10 per cent of the 45 per cent share of renewable energy sources, which is about 50–100 MW from Cambrian systems,”_ he says. The stability, versatility, and ability to provide an uninterrupted supply are some of the unique strengths of geothermal. Even though the developed capacity may be modest, geothermal can provide the base capacity to help balance the fluctuating outputs from solar and wind energy.","Baltic region, Devonian, Geothermal, Kaunas University of Technology, Klaipeda, KTU, Lithuania, Mayur Pal, power plant, sandstone, scaling","Mayur Pal, a researcher at Kaunas University of Technology (KTU), emphasizes Lithuania's geothermal potential for heating, particularly in its western region, drawing lessons from the unsuccessful Klaipeda geothermal project (1997-2000). The Klaipeda demonstration plant, which used four wells targeting Lower Devonian sandstone at 1000 meters, faced technical issues such as gypsum precipitation, declining injectivity, and low flow rates, leading to its closure and bankruptcy in 2017 with a debt exceeding EUR 3 million. Despite these setbacks, Pal highlights that Devonian aquifers in western Lithuania, at depths of 1000-1500 meters, exhibit temperatures around 45-46°C, suitable primarily for heating rather than electricity generation. Deeper deposits at 2-2.5 km, with temperatures near 96°C, could theoretically support power generation but vary in quality due to geological differences, being more favorable in central Lithuania. Pal suggests that leveraging geothermal energy could contribute 5-10% of Lithuania's renewable energy share, approximately 50-100 MW, reducing dependency on imported electricity and gas. The development of geothermal resources presents strategic opportunities for energy resilience, balancing renewable fluctuations and supporting regional leadership in Baltic geothermal applications, with ongoing technical and investment challenges.",Geothermal energy; Renewable energy

Particularly in cities such as [Munich](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/munich-germany-aims-for-co2-neutral-heating-by-2040-primarily-with-geothermal/) and [Vienna](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-geothermal-atlas-shows-shallow-geothermal-potential-in-vienna-austria/), where deep geothermal energy is accessible and district heating network infrastructure is already available. Given the strong seasonal variation in heat demand under European climate conditions, technologies such as absorption chillers, heat pumps, and heat transformers can be used to optimize geothermal energy utilization and reduce the necessity for other energy sources such as fossil fuels. To increase the annual operating hours of absorption systems, a reversible absorption machine is proposed. This design enables cold production during the summer and enhanced heat extraction from the geothermal source during the winter. In order to demonstrate the reversible concept, an absorption heat pump test rig, which combines the three operating modes, chiller, heat pump, and heat transformer, was designed and is currently put into operation at the Chair of Energy Systems of the Technical University of Munich. This talk explores the application potential of absorption technology in the context of geothermal energy. It provides a concise overview of the different absorption cycles—chiller, heat pump, and heat transformer—and illustrates how these three operating modes can be integrated into a single system. The GeoReACh test rig will be introduced, and the planned experimental scope will be outlined and opened up for discussion. Ludwig Irrgang holds a Bachelor’s Degrees in Physics and in Engineering Science and a Master’s Degree in Energy and Process Engineering from the Technical University of Munich. He is currently a Research Assistant at the TU Munich working on projects related to cooling from geothermal energy, air condensers for ORCs, and integration of heat pumps with geothermal resources.

A new study by Daniel Dichter of [Quaise Energy](https://www.quaise.energy/) provides some valuable insight on the design of a binary geothermal power plant to produce electricity from superhot geothermal systems. More specifically, the study proposes that a water-based binary cycle provides more design flexibility and delivers higher efficiency than a standard hydrocarbon-based binary cycle for production temperatures above 300 °C. The full paper was presented at the [50th Stanford Geothermal Workshop](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/call-for-abstracts-50th-stanford-geothermal-workshop-february-2025/) and can be accessed in full [via this link.](https://pangea.stanford.edu/ERE/pdf/IGAstandard/SGW/2025/Dichter.pdf) Many studies have already been published citing the significant benefits, in terms of power output and efficiency, of tapping into superhot geothermal resources, or those with temperatures at above 375 °C. Considering that most geothermal power plants currently operate at temperatures between 100 to 250 °C, little is yet known about how a geothermal power plant should be designed for much higher temperatures. The study examines the design parameters and efficiency of binary geothermal power plants using different working fluids under a production temperatures of 300 to 350 °C. The standard working fluids are considered in the study (isobutane, butane, isopentane, pentane, cyclopentane), and compared with water. A double-pressure cycle was used for the simulations, as it strikes a balance between higher utilization and lower costs and complexity. The maximum utilization or exergetic efficiency was used as the primary metric in comparing the different scenarios. Comparison of utilization indicates that hydrocarbons generally are better options for binary power plants at temperatures below 240 °C. However, water outperforms butane and pentane at temperatures above 300 °C. As production shifts to become more vapor-dominated, the advantage shifts over to water with only cyclopentane providing comparable utilization numbers. The study presents different power plant design scenarios comparing water and cyclopentane. The conclusion is that the higher critical temperature of water allows for more design flexibility, such as more cycle stages thus resulting in higher utilization. It also had other advantages, such as needing fewer wells, a smaller heat exchanger, and a smaller condenser.","binary cycle, cyclopentane, Daniel Dichter, efficiency, Geothermal, power plant, power plant design, Quaise Energy, Supercritical, superhot geothermal","A recent study by Daniel Dichter of Quaise Energy explores the design advantages of water-based binary geothermal power plants for superhot resource exploitation (temperatures above 300 °C), presented at the 50th Stanford Geothermal Workshop. The research assesses the efficiency of binary cycle configurations using various working fluids, including hydrocarbons (isobutane, butane, pentane, cyclopentane) and water, noting that water displays superior exergy efficiency at temperatures above 300 °C. The study employs a double-pressure cycle model, demonstrating that hydrocarbons outperform water below 240 °C, but water outperforms them at higher temperatures, with cyclopentane showing comparable utilization. The findings highlight that water’s higher critical temperature enables more flexible, efficient design options—such as additional cycle stages—and reduces infrastructure demands (fewer wells, smaller heat exchangers and condensers). This insight into high-temperature geothermal system optimization suggests that practical implementation could enhance power output, reduce operational costs, and facilitate more effective utilization of superhot geothermal resources—an area currently limited by traditional plant designs optimized for lower temperatures.

This September, the [Spanish Geothermal Association](https://www.geoenergia.es/) (GEOENERGÍA) submitted its proposals to the public information process for the **draft Royal Decree regulating heating and cooling networks and thermal origin guarantees** , promoted by the Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge. GEOENERGÍA highly values the publication of this Draft Royal Decree, as it represents a decisive step in the deployment of heating and cooling networks in Spain and in the recognition of renewable thermal sources, particularly geothermal energy. The draft regulation promoted by the Ministry includes key elements for the development of heating and cooling networks. Among them, it provides the necessary flexibility to facilitate the promotion of fifth-generation networks for the supply of heating and cooling, including a proactive policy for the incorporation of all types of waste heat into the renewable thermal mix. GEOENERGÍA has submitted **three priority proposals** , which it considers essential to achieving an effective and uniform deployment of heating and cooling networks throughout the country: It is proposed to declare heating and cooling networks as services of general interest , on par with other basic utilities such as electricity, telecommunications, hydrocarbons, and water, which have specific sectoral regulations. The creation of this status would provide legal certainty and enable more streamlined and orderly access to the use of public and heritage land, avoiding the need for complex state-owned concession processes, which are limited in scope and ill-suited for these infrastructures. This recognition would facilitate more efficient deployment on an equal footing with other essential utilities, while also reinforcing its strategic role in the energy transition and in reducing external dependence. In addition to the cooperation obligations of waste heat source owners, accompanying measures should be established to incentivize their use by both producers and consumers, provided it is technically and economically feasible. To this end, a system combining incentives and penalties is proposed, considering heat dissipation into the atmosphere as a waste. This measure would contribute to maximizing the use of an available energy resource, reducing energy losses, strengthening the overall efficiency of the system, and generating environmental and economic benefits, aligned with the goals of climate neutrality and the transition toward a more sustainable energy model. It is proposed to make it mandatory for public administrations to contract heat and/or cooling provided by renewable or residual thermal networks, provided that technical and economic conditions allow it. In this way, the administrations would reinforce their exemplary role in the decarbonization of the air conditioning sector, boosting initial demand and helping to ensure the economic viability of the networks in their early stages of development. This measure would foster a framework of stability for developers and operators, encouraging investment, accelerating project deployment, and positioning public institutions as catalysts for change toward a cleaner, more efficient, and more resilient thermal energy system.","cooling, GeoEnergia, geotermia, Geothermal, heating, Legislation, PiensaGeotermia, regulation, Royal Decree, Spain","In September, the Spanish Geothermal Association (GEOENERGÍA) responded positively to the draft Royal Decree on heating and cooling networks, initiated by Spain’s Ministry for Ecological Transition.

The latest update from the municipality states that this has now been pushed to 2025 after the project has secured funding of EUR 50 million from the Federal Funding for Efficient Heat Networks (BEW). The project will now continue to its Phase 2 implementation, but Silenos Energy will no longer be involved. This development comes up because of two factors: * Based on an evaluation of the current framework conditions and financing option, the municipality of Gräfelfing can finance the project more cost-effectively without a privately financed share; * Changes in funding conditions from the Federal Government and the State of Bavaria has made it necessary to make far-reaching adjustments to the corporate and financing structure, and it becomes fundamentally simpler to proceed with the project without the joint venture. Thus, a mutual agreement was reached for Silenos Energy to transfer all its shares to FWNG. Following the transfer of shares, a tender for the drilling and construction work is expected to be announced soon. _“I wish GGK every success in the realization of the geothermal project. As project manager for the past few years, I am convinced that together we have paved the way for the implementation of the geothermal project and that this will create a groundbreaking and, above all, sustainable heat supply for the municipality of Gräfelfing,”_ said Silenos Managing Director Felix Koselleck. _“I am very pleased that years of careful preparatory work have borne fruit and that work is now underway in the foreseeable future.

The geothermal project of [Deutsche ErdWärme](https://deutsche-erdwaerme.de/) in Graben-Neudorf in Baden-Württemberg, Germany is progressing according to plan, with preparations ongoing for the drilling of a second well in 2026. To better understand the potential of the geothermal resource, Deutsche ErdWärme applied for a second injection phase to the Freiburg Mining Authority. Following successful approval, an injection test lasting several weeks is planned for the fourth quarter of 2025. The goal is to validate the reservoir’s sustainable injection capacity and to operationally test operating procedures under real-world conditions. In parallel with the preparations for the injection phase, the second well is already being planned and is scheduled to be drilled soon. All previous findings will be incorporated into the technical and geological planning to advance the project and thus the local heat transition. _“A second drilling cellar is already in place for the well, and planning for the heating plant is well underway,”_ said Rolf Herrmann, Head of Geothermal Engineering for Deutsche Erdwärme. The final use of the geothermal plant—as a combined heat and power plant (CHP) or as a pure heating plant—depends on further tests and infrastructure planning. The planned heat supply for the Bruchsal, Dettenheim, and Bretten region plays a particularly central role in this. State Secretary Dr. Andre Baumann from the Ministry for the Environment, Climate Protection, and Energy recently visited the drilling site in Graben-Neudorf.

kenya-policy-geothermal-development.md,https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/kenya-policy-geothermal-development/,How Kenya’s energy policy is driving geothermal development,Alexander Richter,22 Apr 2025,"Kenya’s updated energy policy and auction mechanisms are transforming geothermal development. Explore how regulatory reforms are pushing clean energy goals. Kenya stands at a strategic crossroads in its energy transition, with ambitious targets for renewable energy and universal electricity access by 2030. Geothermal energy plays a central role in achieving these goals, and recent policy reforms are proving pivotal in shaping the country’s geothermal future, so a “[Kenya 2024 – Energy Policy Review](https://www.iea.org/reports/kenya-2024)” report released by IEA one week ago. Kenya remains to be the geothermal powerhouse of Africa. As of 2024, geothermal energy accounts for approximately 47% of the country’s electricity generation, making it the largest single source in Kenya’s renewable energy mix. [With 985 MW installed capacity](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/thinkgeoenergys-top-10-geothermal-countries-2024-power/) and an estimated potential of up to 10 GW, geothermal is both a foundation and a frontier for Kenya’s clean energy ambitions. Today, the country ranks no. 6 in the Top 10 of geothermal countries, only about 15 MW shy of joining the 1 GW Geothermal Countries Club. The government’s [Vision 2030](https://vision2030.go.ke/) aims to transition the country into a newly industrializing, middle-income economy, and energy access is a cornerstone of that strategy. Kenya’s target of 100% renewable power generation and universal electricity access by 2030 underlines the importance of geothermal as a stable, dispatchable energy source in a mix increasingly composed of variable renewables like solar and wind. The [Energy Act of 2019](https://kenyalaw.org/kl/fileadmin/pdfdownloads/Acts/2019/EnergyAct__No.1of2019.PDF) remains the cornerstone of Kenya’s energy policy. It provides a comprehensive legal structure for renewable energy development, including geothermal. Key provisions include: * Allocation of undeveloped geothermal resources to the national government. * Exploration licenses valid for two years (renewable), and production licenses valid for up to 30 years. * Royalties structured at 2.5% for the first decade and between 2–5% thereafter. Further, the [Least Cost Power Development Plan](https://www.epra.go.ke/energy-planning-inep-medium-term-plans) (LCPDP) guides future investments, ensuring geothermal continues to be prioritized due to its reliability and cost-effectiveness. Complementing these are procurement reforms: Kenya is **transitioning from the former feed-in-tariff (FiT) system to a Renewable Energy Auction Policy (REAP)**. This shift aims to increase transparency and cost-competitiveness, especially for large-scale projects over 20 MW. Geothermal developers are now selected via competitive bidding, enhancing investor confidence and enabling better alignment with national demand forecasts. To fully realize its geothermal potential, Kenya is also opening its electricity market. The Electricity Market, Bulk Supply and Open Access Regulations (2024) permit private participation in transmission and distribution, historically state-controlled. These reforms, while still in early stages, are intended to attract private capital into grid infrastructure and encourage more independent power producers (IPPs) to enter the geothermal space. Despite progress, challenges remain. Kenya’s grid experiences high transmission and distribution losses—23% in 2023—due to outdated infrastructure, theft, and billing inefficiencies. Nevertheless, smart grid initiatives and performance-based regulations are underway, aiming to improve reliability and reduce losses, which in turn would make geothermal investments more bankable. Geothermal in Kenya is not limited to power generation. The Geothermal Development Company (GDC) is actively exploring direct-use applications in agriculture, industry, and tourism. [Demonstration projects in milk pasteurization](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/gdc-pilot-testing-direct-use-applications-of-geothermal-energy/), aquaculture, and greenhouse heating are already operational. These applications present new commercial opportunities and foster rural economic development. Furthermore, Kenya is pioneering in geothermal-powered carbon capture, with the [Project Hummingbird direct air capture](https://www.klimate.co/project/project-hummingbird) facility in Naivasha – one of the world’s largest pilots of its kind—illustrating how geothermal can underpin innovative climate technologies. Despite high inflation and fiscal constraints, Kenya remains a top destination for development finance and climate investment in Africa. [The Energy Transition and Investment Plan (2023–2050)](https://energy.go.ke/sites/default/files/KAWI/Kenya-ETIP-2050%202.pdf) estimates that $600 billion will be required to meet climate and energy targets, with geothermal continuing to play a central role. To unlock greater private sector participation, especially in geothermal development, Kenya must address regulatory complexity, improve inter-agency coordination, and provide clarity around fiscal incentives. The upcoming review of the National Energy Policy (2018) offers a strategic opportunity to streamline governance and accelerate geothermal deployment. **Kenya’s geothermal sector is a model for how policy can foster renewable energy leadership. With a solid legal framework, proactive auction mechanisms, and growing international interest, the country is poised to scale up geothermal deployment significantly. The challenge now lies in translating policy into streamlined execution, robust investment, and equitable access – delivering both climate resilience and inclusive economic growth.** To read the IEA report, check out this [link](https://www.iea.org/reports/kenya-2024).

The city of Bogács in Hungary has completed the construction of a heating distribution system that utilizes excess geothermal heat from its existing thermal baths. A minimal amount of the investment on the project came from the city, as about 90% of the costs were received in the form of a subsidy from the Swiss Fund under the “Geothermal Energy Resources for District and Urban Heating” program. The system now provides inexpensive and emissions-free heating to eleven public institution buildings, including the Mayor’s Office, the Municipal Library, a Kindergarten, Elementary School, Central Kitchen, and the Community House. **Utilizing excess heat from the thermal spa** Since the 2000s, there have already been efforts to more efficiently use the excess heat from the thermal spa in Bogács. Water at 70 °C is discharged from the thermal well in the Bogács spa area, which is too hot for filling the pools. Thus, some of the heat is redirected to heat the buildings in the spa area, and for the air-conditioning equipment for the dehumidification of the indoor pools. There was, however, still some excess heat extracted to reduce the temperature of the water to the ideal 37-38 °C for the pools. The plan was then to use the excess heat to provide heating to a number of public buildings located outside the thermal spa. To do this, the municipality had to build a new heating distribution network, as well as a new connection to the the existing energy supply system of the heating center. The city estimated an investment of HUF 205 million (approx. 570,000 for the project). Csendesné Farkas Edit, Mayor of Bogacs, also recounted how the city had difficulties in securing permits for the project. The plan had to go through several authorities, including the Environmental Protection Authority, the Water Directorate, and Disaster Management. The permit process started in June 2023 and the permit was granted in August 2024. **A project enabled by significant funding support** The public procurement procedure was conducted in the spring of 2024, and Midvex Épít? Kft. submitted the most favorable offer, for a net cost of 180 million HUF. Construction began in September 2024, and the works were completed at the end of December. In January, test heating of the system was done, with thermal heat providing heat in practically every building, and there was no need for gas heating. Meanwhile, in May 2024, the Swiss Fund announced a call for applications for a grant for projects utilizing geothermal energy. The city applied for the grant. Following the evaluation, the Evaluation Committee decided on a grant of 168.8 million HUF, thus covering more than 90% of the project costs. This freed up the money from the city, which was then redirected to the renovation of a municipal building. **A win-win scenario** The result of the project is that there will be practically no heating costs for the public buildings connected to the geothermal network. Gas heating will only be used in cases of extreme cold. This means that the city saves HUF 20-25 million per year. More so, there is less excess heat needed to be extracted from the thermal water before they used to fill the pools, so less cool water is also needed. More importantly, the switch from gas heating will reduce the CO2 emissions from the heating system while also protecting it from the vulnerability of gas prices.","Bogács, district heating, funding, Geothermal, grant, heating, Hungary, networked geothermal, spa, Swiss Fund","The Hungarian city of Bogács has completed a geothermal heating project utilizing excess heat from its existing thermal baths, targeting public buildings such as the Mayor’s Office and schools. The system, developed with approximately 90% funding from the Swiss Fund’s “Geothermal Energy Resources for District and Urban Heating” program, was constructed at a cost of around 570,000 USD, following permit challenges from multiple authorities. Construction began in September 2024, concluding in December, with system testing in January 2025 confirming effective heat distribution without gas dependence. The project aims to provide inexpensive, emissions-free heating to eleven buildings, replacing conventional gas systems, and reducing annual heating costs by approximately 20-25 million HUF (about 70,000 USD).

The plan is to drill a direction well up to 2750 meters long to a depth of over two kilometers under Sveifluhálsinn to the northwest. The goal is for the well to verify the high-temperature resources and evaluate their utilization in the Sveifluháls – Austurengjar area. Additional deep exploration wells are planned, and preparations have already begun for the next drilling site with planning work and an environmental impact assessment. Drilling operations are being done by [Iceland Drilling](https://www.jardboranir.is/), using the Odin drill rig. The drill is powered by electricity, so drilling does not involve the use of oil to power its power plants, except for the first few weeks, until a new transformer station is in operation. If the research yields the desired results, the aim is to build a geothermal power plant at Sveifluháls. The exact location of the planned power plant is yet to be decided. The results from the research drilling will be critical to this decision, as will the environmental assessment of the projects and the interaction with the nature of Krýsuvík and other economic activities in the area. An environmental assessment for the proposed construction in Krýsuvík is being prepared, but the overall project timeline spans nearly a decade. The geothermal power plant in Sveifluháls was part of a list of planned new geothermal power projects in Iceland [announced back in 2016](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/iceland-could-see-up-to-7-new-geothermal-projects-until-2035/). The Hafnarfjörður Municipality owns the part of the Krýsuvík area where the research is being conducted. Krýsuvík is a popular outdoor recreation area and a popular tourist destination, but also has a significant industrial history. The geothermal development in Krýsuvík is expected to provide security to the supply of hot water, as the area currently predominantly relies on supply from the Nesjavellir hydroelectric power plant and the Hellisheidi hydroelectric power plant in the Hengil area. In June 2024, the Hafnarfjörður Municipality and HS Orka signed an agreement on authorization for research, land use, land lease, and utilization of resource rights in connection with the potential utilization of resources in Krýsuvík. Part of the agreement is that the parties will work together on other developments that utilize resource flows from the power plant, similar to what is being done under the name Auðlindagarðsinn at HS Orka’s power plants in Svartsengi and Reykjanesvirkjun. Emphasis will be placed on the development of eco-friendly tourism that is in harmony with the environment and nature, along with facilities for outdoor recreation as well as green business activities such as algae cultivation, natural chemical processing, greenhouse cultivation and more.","drilling heating, exploration drilling, Geothermal, HS Orka, Iceland, Iceland Drilling, Krysuvik, power plant, Sveifluhals, tourism","HS Orka has initiated exploration drilling in the Sveifluháls area of Krýsuvík, Iceland, to verify high-temperature geothermal resources for potential power generation and heating.

At least seven applicants have withdrawn from the program this year, citing issues sourcing gas turbines in time to meet the fund’s project deadlines. As a result, none of the intended 10 GW of new power capacity have materialized so far. **A path forward for geothermal** Geothermal advocates see this as a critical opportunity to reposition the TEF as a technology-neutral mechanism for dispatchable power – one that can support emerging geothermal developers in Texas who are leveraging oil and gas expertise and infrastructure to tap the state’s subsurface heat. _“Opening the TEF to geothermal offers a lifeline to projects that can provide 24/7 low-carbon energy using skills and resources Texas already has,_ ” said a geothermal industry advocate close to the discussions. A second proposal under consideration would allow geothermal projects in the 10 to 100 MW range – smaller than typical gas plants but ideal for current geothermal systems – to qualify for TEF financing. **Political and energy landscape in transition** These geothermal-friendly proposals stand in contrast to other energy-related bills advancing through the Texas Senate, many of which aim to restrict wind and solar development or mandate that renewable energy be backed by fossil fuel power. One such bill, H.B. 3356, would require solar developers to purchase fossil fuel-based backup power, a move critics argue would cost ratepayers billions while exacerbating grid instability. At the same time, lawmakers are weighing a separate $2 billion proposal to support nuclear energy, although no nuclear projects in Texas are currently close to being shovel-ready. **Why Texas is poised for geothermal growth** While Texas lacks the shallow, high-temperature geothermal resources found in states like Nevada or California, it boasts [deep, hot rock formations](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/hotrock-geothermal-research-consortium-kicks-off-in-austin-texas/) and a vast workforce skilled in subsurface mapping, drilling, and reservoir engineering—all critical to modern geothermal development. Recent geothermal resource maps by Project InnerSpace have identified extensive heat resources beneath the state, reinforcing its potential as a future geothermal hub. Even U.S. federal energy leadership has expressed support for geothermal. Energy Secretary Chris Wright and President Trump have both highlighted next-generation geothermal as a strategic clean energy opportunity, including in recent Earth Day messaging. **For the Geothermal Sector** The move to open the TEF to geothermal could mark a turning point for geothermal development in Texas, offering funding, validation, and visibility for an emerging industry segment. It may also serve as a blueprint for other U.S. states with existing fossil fuel infrastructure looking to diversify into clean, dispatchable power.","development, Geothermal, Legislation, Texas, Texas Energy Fund","Texas legislators are considering amendments to the $5 billion Texas Energy Fund (TEF) to include geothermal energy projects, reflecting a strategic shift toward dispatchable, low-carbon power sources. The proposed legislation, authored by Rep. AJ Louderback and approved unanimously by a Texas House committee, would formally classify geothermal as an eligible energy source for low-interest loans, aiming to bolster emerging geothermal development utilizing the state's existing oil and gas expertise. The current TEF primarily incentivizes natural gas plant construction, but project withdrawals have hampered progress, with no new capacity yet formally added. Advocates highlight Texas's deep, hot rock formations and extensive subsurface knowledge as key assets for geothermal growth, despite lacking high-temperature shallow resources found in other states. Federal support, including remarks from Energy Secretary Chris Wright and President Trump, underscores geothermal's strategic importance. Smaller-scale projects (10-100 MW) are targeted for TEF funding, aligning with typical geothermal capacities. If approved, this move could accelerate Texas's geothermal industry development and provide a model for other fossil-fuel-rich states seeking clean, dispatchable energy options. The legislation occurs within a broader Texas energy policy landscape characterized by contrasting proposals supporting renewable energy and nuclear expansion.",Geothermal energy; Funding
