[//ads.thinkgeoenergy.com/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=144&cb=0&n=a886266d]//ads.thinkgeoenergy.com/delivery/ck.php?n=a886266d&cb=0 [//ads.thinkgeoenergy.com/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=34&cb=0&n=a62ebb80]//ads.thinkgeoenergy.com/delivery/ck.php?n=a62ebb80&cb=0 [//ads.thinkgeoenergy.com/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=10&cb=0&n=ada237ed]//ads.thinkgeoenergy.com/delivery/ck.php?n=ada237ed&cb=0 This September, the Spanish Geothermal Association [https://www.geoenergia.es/] (GEOENERGÍA) submitted its proposals to the public information process for the draft Royal Decree regulating heating and cooling networks and thermal origin guarantees , promoted by the Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge. GEOENERGÍA highly values the publication of this Draft Royal Decree, as it represents a decisive step in the deployment of heating and cooling networks in Spain and in the recognition of renewable thermal sources, particularly geothermal energy. The draft regulation promoted by the Ministry includes key elements for the development of heating and cooling networks. Among them, it provides the necessary flexibility to facilitate the promotion of fifth-generation networks for the supply of heating and cooling, including a proactive policy for the incorporation of all types of waste heat into the renewable thermal mix. GEOENERGÍA has submitted three priority proposals , which it considers essential to achieving an effective and uniform deployment of heating and cooling networks throughout the country: SERVICES OF GENERAL INTEREST It is proposed to declare heating and cooling networks as services of general interest , on par with other basic utilities such as electricity, telecommunications, hydrocarbons, and water, which have specific sectoral regulations. The creation of this status would provide legal certainty and enable more streamlined and orderly access to the use of public and heritage land, avoiding the need for complex state-owned concession processes, which are limited in scope and ill-suited for these infrastructures. This recognition would facilitate more efficient deployment on an equal footing with other essential utilities, while also reinforcing its strategic role in the energy transition and in reducing external dependence. SUPPORTING MEASURES FOR THE USE OF WASTE HEAT In addition to the cooperation obligations of waste heat source owners, accompanying measures should be established to incentivize their use by both producers and consumers, provided it is technically and economically feasible. To this end, a system combining incentives and penalties is proposed, considering heat dissipation into the atmosphere as a waste. This measure would contribute to maximizing the use of an available energy resource, reducing energy losses, strengthening the overall efficiency of the system, and generating environmental and economic benefits, aligned with the goals of climate neutrality and the transition toward a more sustainable energy model. EXEMPLARY ROLE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS It is proposed to make it mandatory for public administrations to contract heat and/or cooling provided by renewable or residual thermal networks, provided that technical and economic conditions allow it. In this way, the administrations would reinforce their exemplary role in the decarbonization of the air conditioning sector, boosting initial demand and helping to ensure the economic viability of the networks in their early stages of development. This measure would foster a framework of stability for developers and operators, encouraging investment, accelerating project deployment, and positioning public institutions as catalysts for change toward a cleaner, more efficient, and more resilient thermal energy system. Established in 2024 [https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/spanish-geothermal-assocation-geoenergia-launched-to-promote-geothermal-in-spain/], GEOENERGIA | The Spanish Geothermal Association [https://www.linkedin.com/company/geoenerg%C3%ADa-asociaci%C3%B3n-espa%C3%B1ola-de-geotermia/] promotes the consolidation of geothermal energy in Spain as a fundamental renewable solution for decarbonization and a strategic contribution to the Spanish and European energy transition.

They suggest declaring these networks as services of general interest to ease land access, incentivizing waste heat utilization through supportive measures, and mandating public administrations to contract renewable-based thermal services to boost demand. These initiatives seek to enhance deployment, efficiency, and sustainability of thermal networks in Spain's energy transition.

[//ads.thinkgeoenergy.com/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=144&cb=1&n=a886266d]//ads.thinkgeoenergy.com/delivery/ck.php?n=a886266d&cb=1 [//ads.thinkgeoenergy.com/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=34&cb=1&n=a62ebb80]//ads.thinkgeoenergy.com/delivery/ck.php?n=a62ebb80&cb=1 [//ads.thinkgeoenergy.com/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=10&cb=1&n=ada237ed]//ads.thinkgeoenergy.com/delivery/ck.php?n=ada237ed&cb=1 The Government of Indonesia is making progress towards creating a policy environment that promotes the growth of the country’s installed geothermal power capacity. This was a key part of the message of Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) Bahlil Lahadalia at the opening of the Indonesia International Geothermal Convention and Exhibition [https://iigce.com/] (IIGCE) held in Jakarta on 17-19 September 2025. “We know that geothermal energy is a renewable energy source, and Indonesia has quite large reserves, the largest in the world. And of this, we can only manage approximately 10 percent. This means there is still 90% of this potential,” said the Minister. Indonesia currently has an installed geothermal power generation capacity of 2,744 MWe, placing it securely at second rank worldwide [https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/thinkgeoenergys-top-10-geothermal-countries-2024-power/]. However, this is only about 10% of the geothermal potential of the country, which is estimated to be about 23,742 MWe. Given this large untapped potential, Bahlil called for an immediate auction of Geothermal Working Areas (WKP). Starting this year, WKP auctions will be conducted through the Geothermal Energy Information System (GENESIS) platform, [https://genesis.ebtke.esdm.go.id/gdr/] a digital platform for geothermal management. This is part of the efforts of the ESDM to simplify permitting and regulations with the aim of reducing the permit processing time from 18 months to only 5 days [https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/indonesia-aims-to-shorten-geothermal-permit-process-to-just-five-days/]. “One thing investors dislike is complicated regulations. The more complicated the regulations, the less they appeal to investors. Therefore, our program over the past year has been to cut various regulatory hurdles that hinder the acceleration of the geothermal sector. We’ve cut them all,” commented Bahlil. The Indonesian Government has also committed to the building of 48,000 circuit kilometers of transmission network to help promote the new and renewable energy. This is part of the 2025-2034 Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL). Several agreements were also signed at the IIGCE 2025 covering commercial cooperation between business entities, capacity building, technology development, and financing commitments with a capacity of 265 MW and a total investment of USD 1.5 billion (IDR 25 trillion). Source: ESDM [https://www.esdm.go.id/en/media-center/news-archives/indonesia-siap-jadi-negara-produsen-listrik-panas-bumi-terbesar-dunia]","At IIGCE 2025, Indonesia's government, led by Minister Bahlil Lahadalia, announced a strategic push to expand geothermal energy, aiming to become the world's largest producer. Despite current capacity of 2,744 MWe—only 10% of its estimated 23,742 MWe potential—Indonesia plans to accelerate development through immediate auctions of geothermal areas via the GENESIS digital platform. Regulatory reforms aim to cut permit processing from 18 months to five days, facilitating faster project deployment. Additionally, the government is investing in 48,000 km of transmission infrastructure and securing over USD 1.5 billion in agreements for capacity building, technology, and financing to support a long-term renewable energy expansion.

The article, titled “Exposing electrical conductivity anomalies beneath Mount Erciyes, Cappadocia, Turkey, [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377027325001647]” examines the deep structure of Mount Erciyes in the Cappadocia region and reveals electrical conductivity anomalies. Analysis of magnetotelluric (MT) data revealed the presence of high conductivity zones beneath the mountain, suggesting that these anomalies may be related to magmatic processes, hydrothermal fluids, or melt presence. The results provide critical information for geothermal energy research, volcanic risk assessment, and regional tectonic evolution. The study is also dedicated to the memory of our valued colleague Serkan Üner, whom we lost at a young age. This academic research is directly related to the recent geothermal field projects being conducted around Mount Erciyes. Previously published news in JeotermalHaberler reported that geothermal resource exploration [https://www.jeotermalhaberler.com/erciyes-dagi-eteklerinde-jeotermal-kaynak-arama-calismalari-basliyor/] has begun [https://www.jeotermalhaberler.com/erciyes-dagi-eteklerinde-jeotermal-kaynak-arama-calismalari-basliyor/] on the slopes of Tekir Plateau and that the MTA has launched geothermal drilling projects. These studies aim to utilize the hot springs for facilities and tourism investments in the region. It was also stated that drilling conducted by the Kayseri Metropolitan Municipality [https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-resource-found-in-erciyes-mountain-in-kayseri-turkiye/] reached water at a depth of 385 meters with a temperature of 35.9 °C, and that the goal is to reach a depth of 420 meters to find hot water above 50°C. Technical tests on the samples are ongoing, and these findings strongly align with the electrical conductivity anomalies identified in Tank and his team’s study. [https://www.jeotermalhaberler.com/erciyes-dagi-eteklerinde-jeotermal-kaynak-arama-calismalari-basliyor/] Meanwhile, the region’s geothermal potential is being utilized not only for energy and tourism, but also for agricultural production. Work is progressing rapidly on [https://www.jeotermalhaberler.com/kayseride-jeotermal-kaynakli-sera-osbde-calismalar-hizla-ilerliyor/]the Geothermal Greenhouse Organized Industrial Zone project, established in the Elmali neighborhood of Kocasinan. Ten wells are planned for the project, with a target temperature of 60°C and a flow rate of 70 liters per second. This initiative demonstrates that the geothermal potential indicated by academic research around Mount Erciyes can be directly translated into economic and social benefits. In conclusion, the electrical conductivity anomalies discovered deep within Mount Erciyes, combined with geothermal exploration, drilling, and greenhouse projects in the region, offer significant contributions to Türkiye’s vision for sustainable development in energy, agriculture, and tourism. When academic data and field applications are considered together, Erciyes is not only a geological landmark but also on its way to becoming a powerful hub for future geothermal energy.

[https://www.zanskar.com/] (Zanskar) has announced its second deep geothermal discovery at the Pumpernickel site in northern Nevada. The discovery comes following the drilling of a geothermal well at the site, encountering a temperature of ~280 °F (~137 °C) at a depth of ~2500 feet (~762 meters). Zanskar is the first AI-native geothermal company using AI to transform the discovery, assessment, and delivery of geothermal energy. With the resource confirmed via deep drilling, Zanskar will now move to full power development for the Pumpernickel site. The company will drill and construct production and injections wells and power plant, with the first phase of development expected to start delivering electricity to the grid within just three years. REPLICATING PREVIOUS SUCCESS AT A GREENFIELD SITE Following their great success at the Lightning Dock geothermal field in New Mexico [https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/zanskar-repowers-lightning-dock-geothermal-facility-in-new-mexico-to-full-capacity/], Zanskar set out to validate their AI-enabled modeling and targeting tools to explore the geothermal potential at a greenfield site. The Pumpernickel site, located at the Pumpernickel Valley, is described as having sparse data and much higher degree of uncertainty compared to Lightning Dock. Previous attempts at geothermal development at Pumpernickel have been documented through [https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/nevada-geothermal-power/] the years [https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/sierra-geothermal-power-drops-pumpernickel-option/]. The stochastic reservoir modeling approach used in Lightning Dock was also used to plan the wells in Pumpernickel. Using the available legacy geologic data sets and shallow exploration wells, a range of geological scenarios was generated, which were the bases for the recommended drilling targets based on maximizing both temperature and permeability. The two best recommendations were used for well targeting. The first well encountered difficult drilling conditions related to hot and unstable formations. The second well reached the target depth, despite challenges in encountering multiple zones of total circulation loss. Despite difficulties in drilling, all these conditions are indicative of a hot and permeable geothermal system. Aside from encountering high temperatures at relatively shallow depth, the well also encountered multiple loss zones and artesian flow zones. The thick (>60 ft / 18 m) damage zones correlate to exceptional permeability. Based on heat-in-place calculations at <2 kilometers depth, the site can support a Phase 1 20-MWe development. CONVENTIONAL GEOTHERMAL REMAINS VIABLE The success at Pumpernickel proves that there are still greenfield sites in the USA that can be developed for power generation, even at sites where previous attempts have failed. The Pumpernickel site also proves that there is still untapped potential at hydrothermal or “conventional” geothermal resources in the USA, thus countering the perception that next-generation solutions like EGS are the only way to grow the industry. “Our team’s ability to execute with these AI tools and precision drilling is unparalleled,” said Carl Hoiland, Co-founder and CEO at Zanskar. “Our vertically-integrated, AI-native approach to geothermal development is delivering the speed to discovery and speed to development necessary to meet the new paradigm of rapid energy demand growth. These latest deep drilling results only further confirm what we’ve known all along: conventional geothermal resources are far more abundant and bigger than previously believed and are the lowest-cost route to delivering gigawatts of reliable, carbon-free, baseload power at scale.” Using artificial intelligence, advanced geoscience modeling, and modern data collection methods, Zanskar is aiming to make geothermal resource discovery faster, cheaper, and more scalable. Zanskar has already reduced discovery costs per MW by an order of magnitude compared to inflation-adjusted costs incurred by geothermal’s last major greenfield explorers. “At Zanskar, our combination of modern, low-cost, field data collection and large compute geospatial models is proving that we can uncover geothermal resources others miss.” said Joel Edwards, Co-founder and CTO at Zanskar. “But claiming a site has power potential is a lot easier than proving it with a drill bit. Pumpernickel is the latest example of when we go where our models tell us, we deliver, and we’re set up to do this over and over again.” .

The project demonstrates the effectiveness of AI and advanced modeling in identifying high-permeability resources at previously underexplored or unsuccessful sites, highlighting that conventional geothermal in the U.S. remains viable and abundant. Zanskar's innovative methods have significantly reduced discovery costs, emphasizing faster, cheaper, and scalable geothermal resource development.
